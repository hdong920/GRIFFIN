Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\"\n\"You're put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it's difficult, it's difficult to get away from it.

It's a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said.\nTom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available.\n\"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven't got accommodation and haven't got provision,\" he said.\n\"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don't delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can't.\n\"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\"\nA Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence.\nIt added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "There is a \"chronic\" need for more housing for prison leavers in Wales, according to a charity.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

France's Essilor is the world's number one manufacturer of lenses and contact lenses, while Italy's Luxottica is the leading frame manufacturer.\nIt is not obvious that the merger is in the public interest, though the two firms certainly think it is.\n\"The parties' activities are highly complementary and the deal would generate significant synergies and innovation and would be beneficial to customers,\" says Essilor.\nBut there seems to be growing disquiet in the industry.\nGordon Ilett, of the Association of Optometrists, says: \"This now allows the [enlarged] group to control all aspects of supply of product - from manufacture to the end user.\n\"Those businesses who remain as their customers will be indirectly controlled by the terms and conditions imposed by them.\n\"Whether their UK market share, following this merger, is sufficient for examination by the competition authorities is open to debate, but the effect of it will be reduced choice for the consumer, and will most likely result in reduced quality products longer term,\" Mr Ilett adds.\nIf the deal goes through later this year the new company, to be called EssilorLuxottica, will become a behemoth of the industry.\nIt will sell not only lenses and frames around the world but will also be stocking its own optician's shops as well, such as Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters in the US and Australia, both currently owned by Luxottica.\nOne long-standing independent UK wholesaler, who asked to remain anonymous, says the merged firm would be so powerful it would probably squeeze out some competitors.\n\"If those two companies merged there would be a branded frame supplier offering you high-end branded frames, and also offering UK opticians a lens and glazing deal, to suit, so they will control almost everything [they offer] to both independent retailers in the High Street and even the chains,\" he argues.\nIn his view this would amount, almost, to a stranglehold on the supply of high-end glasses, with some rivals giving up.\n\"I imagine it would knock out quite a few glazing houses in the UK, and it would probably knock out other fashion frame houses,\" he adds.\nUnless you know about the eyewear business, or take an interest in investing in big European companies (they both have stock market listings) the names of the two big firms will probably have passed you by.\nBut if you have been inside an optician's shop you will certainly have heard of the brands they own and make. For instance, the leading varifocal lens brand, Varilux, is made by Essilor.\nJust a year ago, in presenting its 2015 financial results to investors, Essilor boasted that it was \"an undisputed leader with only 25% market share\" of the combined world market for prescription lenses, sunglasses lenses and lenses for reading glasses.\nWhen it comes to just the prescription lenses, it has a 41% share of the world market.\nFor its part, Luxottica owns several of its own brand names such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, and it also makes, under licence, spectacle frames which carry high-fashion names such as Armani, Burberry, Bulgari, Chanel, Prada, Ralph Lauren and Versace.\nIn 2015 the Italian firm made almost 10% of the 954 million frames that were sold worldwide that year, and claims that about half a billion of its frames are currently perched on people's noses.\nThe overall industry internationally is in fact quite fragmented with hundreds of other smaller manufacturers and related businesses such as glazing laboratories.\nMarket research firm GFK describes the optical industry as \"a complex and extremely competitive market-space\".\nEven so, with the two firms having a combined turnover of more than 15bn euros (\u00c2\u00a312.8bn), of which 3.5bn euros were in Europe, on the grounds of size alone the proposed merger easily meets the requirements of the European Commission for a formal review.\nThese are:\nAn inquiry would see if the merged firm threatened to be too dominant, thus reducing competition and leading to higher prices for the customers.\nA Luxottica spokesman told the BBC that the firm was confident that any scrutiny would not hinder the deal.\n\"The transaction is subject to mandatory submission to a number of anti-monopoly authorities including the European one, as is customary in transactions of this size and nature,\" he said.\n\"We are confident that the transaction does not raise anti-monopoly issues and will fully co-operate with the anti-monopoly authorities to obtain the required clearance,\" he added.\nThe EU itself says it currently has no comment to make and it has not yet been formally notified of the merger deal under the requirements of its own rules.\nBut the leading chain of opticians, Specsavers, views the impending deal with caution.\n\"Mergers are a continuing trend in optics, but this is a significant development which will result in huge supply chain and retail implications for the industry and consumers worldwide,\" the firm says.\n\"It is unlikely that the impact of the merger will be felt by consumers straight away but we will watch with great interest how the new organisation will arrange itself.\"\nIf you have ever bought a pair of spectacles with anything other than the most basic frame and lenses, you may have gulped at the price, possibly coming to several hundred pounds.\nOf course, not all spectacles are expensive and not all of the sale price goes to the manufacturers.\nOpticians and the wholesalers that supply them are businesses that seek to make a profit.\nThey also need to cover the costs of staff, equipment, shop and office space, stock and all that advertising.\nBut for the manufacturers such as Essilor and Luxottica, it is a stonkingly profitable business.\nOn worldwide sales of 6.7bn euros in 2015, Essilor made operating profits of 1.2bn euros.\nFor the same year, Luxottica sold goods worth 8.8bn euros and made operating profits of 1.4bn euros.\nWith cost-cutting at a merged business projected to save between 400m and 600m euros per year, profits could be boosted even further.\nWill customers benefit as well?\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Since their impending merger was announced in January, there has been remarkably little comment about the huge proposed deal to combine Essilor and Luxottica.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

I don't think the fastest team on the day were permitted to race.\n\"There are certain chosen riders on the team who will not have experienced the culture of fear and will not have been on the receiving end of that - the bullying, the harassment, being frozen out of opportunities.\n\"It was horrid - it was not the training environment I expected. There was no choice. If you rocked the boat, you were out. There was no alternative.\n\"Medals at any cost, that's how it was whenever I was there, certainly in 2012.\"\nHouvenaghel said she also witnessed the sexism that has been highlighted by other female riders, and also claims she was discriminated against because of her age.\n\"I can certainly relate to the bullying,\" she said. \"For me personally, I felt it was more ageism - being a little bit older than my team-mates, it didn't seem to be something that the staff necessarily wanted for our team in 2012.\n\"They didn't care about what happened to me afterwards. I never heard another thing from them.\n\"After six years of constantly medalling at World Cups, World Championships, nationals, both on the track and on the road, they discarded me in a very undignified way from the team, which I don't feel was right.\"\nFourteen-time Paralympic gold medallist Dame Sarah Storey told BBC Sport that elite level sport in Britain is \"cut-throat\" but there are \"no excuses for crossing that line\" into bullying.\nAsked about the balance between winning and athlete welfare, the 39-year-old replied: \"It's a really difficult question because you have to be a human being, you have to allow for people to make mistakes. But the currency is race wins, the currency is gold medals.\n\"It's not an excuse but you have to have a thick skin in sport, you have to be able to take the rough with the smooth because of the racing that you go through.\n\"But there are no excuses for crossing that line, and if those lines have been crossed they will be found out and they'll be dealt with.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "A \"medal at any cost\" approach created a \"culture of fear\" at British Cycling, says former rider Wendy Houvenaghel.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

But Kareem Badr says people did laugh in 2009 when he and two friends paid $20,000 (\u00c2\u00a313,000) for the Hideout in Austin, when it wasn't making money and the previous owner decided not to renew the lease.\n\"We took over a sinking ship and each brought a bucket to bail it out,\" says Mr Badr.\n\"None of us had any experience of running a business. But we loved what we were doing enough that it carried us through.\"\nThree years ago he was able to quit his day job and draw a salary from the club.\nMr Badr says it's still not as much as he used to make as a programmer (about $80,000 a year), but he now employs around 25 part time and contract workers.\nAnd he recently expanded the premises, taking over the adjoining coffee house which sells alcohol, and leasing more theatre space.\nMr Badr says: \"I think my background in computer science helped because I can take a big problem, break it up into small chunks, and figure out how to make it better and more efficient.\n\"That's basically what we did for every aspect of the business. And by doing that it naturally started to improve.\"\nMr Badr may have been helped by national trends, which imply a growing enthusiasm for comedy clubs in the US.\nAn industry report from data firm Ibis World expects total US annual comedy club revenue to grow by 1.8% over the next five years to $344.6m in 2020.\n\"When the Hideout first opened it was the only improv theatre in Austin,\" says Mr Badr.\n\"But now there are five [comedy] schools and four theatres. We were at the right place at the right time.\"\nWhile the Ibis World report showed that dozens of US comedy clubs were forced to close in the wake of the 2008 recession, when fewer people had disposable income to spend on live entertainment, Stephen Rosenfield, director of the American Comedy Institute in New York, says stand-up comedy is now entering a new golden age.\n\"The US has comedy clubs all over the country, not just in big cities, and they require talent,\" he says.\n\"In any field there are those at the top who make dynastic fortunes. But because of the significance of the local comedy club, there is a career and a living to be made by good comedians who are not superstars.\"\nMr Rosenfield says the growing popularity of stand-up comedy is fuelled in part by younger audiences, who view humorous TV hosts such as Jon Stewart, Jay Leno and Steve Colbert as their primary source for news.\n\"It's not just entertaining them, it's also informing them,\" he says. \"There's a new immediacy to stand-up that makes it much more appealing to a generation that's on social media, tweeting, face booking and blogging.\"\nBut clubs don't only make money from entertainers. Alcohol alone can bring in as much as 40% of the night's takings, and many clubs demand that audiences buy a minimum number of drinks per person.\n\"A club really has three businesses going on,\" says Mr Rosenfield.\n\"It's an entertainment entity, a restaurant and a bar. They make money from selling drinks and dinners, and they make money from the cover charge.\n\"There are usually three people on the bill. The opening act is the new comedian. They do about 20 minutes and introduce the other comics.\nThe middle act does about half an hour, and then there's the headliner. They almost always have TV credits, and are the ones people are coming to see. That headliner could be making six figures a year.\"\nTop-tier performers make much more. According to Forbes, Canadian comedian Russell Peters grossed $19m with 64 shows in 2013, while industry veteran Jerry Seinfeld is the highest paid comedian in the US, set to earn $36m this year.\nSteve Byrne, 41, is a veteran stand-up comedian based in LA, and star of his own television show Sullivan and Son, which ran for three seasons.\nHe describes himself as a successful mid-level comedian who makes an annual six figure salary mainly from touring.\nAnd although he was close to hitting a million dollars a year before his show was cancelled in 2014, he says most comedians make money at clubs and do television to boost their brand rather than their income.\nMr Bryne says: \"Gigs vary because it depends what you're contracted at.\n\"If it's somebody starting off in the business it could be $1,500 a show. For somebody who's had some TV credits you could go from $4,500 to $7,500.\n\"And if you're just a knock out comic, then you're coming in and getting a door deal. You're taking all the tickets, and the club gets the concessions.\"\nMr Byrne says hard work is the key to success. There is no magic short cut, and few lucky breaks.\n\"The one single thing that an aspiring comedian should do is write, write, write. What is it that makes you laugh?\n\"Your voice should resonate with your audience. So find your voice and you will find your audience.\"\nWhile the music and film industries have been impacted by the internet, such as illegal downloads and reduced album sales, Mr Rosenfield says the online world has actually given live comedy a boost.\n\"The format of comedy, particularly stand-up, lends itself to digital media like nothing else. One terrific joke can get a million hits,\" he says.\n\"It's become a new metric for a club manager. If a booker sees that a comic has 500,000 online followers - they'll book him almost sight unseen. That's it.\n\"Digital is gigantically important and has been for a while.\"\nBut in the end, the success of comedy comes down to a very simple fact - people need to laugh.\nBack in 2001 Steve Byrne was a comedian in New York when terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Centre on 11 September.\nHe says: \"We all thought 'who's going to come to a comedy club? The dream's over, I've got to get a real job now'.\n\"But after a week, I forget which club was the first one to open its doors, but it was packed. People needed an outlet.\n\"And I remember for months on end those clubs in New York City were just jam packed. That was the thing that told me that this was a profession that is foolproof.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Have you heard the one about the computer programmer who bought a failing comedy club in Texas and turned it into a million dollar a year business?", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

BT's retirement scheme, inherited from its time as a state-owned utility, has assets of about \u00c2\u00a340bn and a deficit, on some measures, of about \u00c2\u00a310bn, even though BT has poured in billions of pounds in recent years to redress the gap.\nSenior sources at the company say that about 80% of the scheme relates to Openreach, the internet infrastructure provider that BT's rivals would like to see spun off.\nSeparating the pension as part of a break-up would be a costly headache - and there is the small matter of a government guarantee on part of the scheme, something that BT fought in the courts to preserve and won.\nCreating two new pension schemes, with the risk of weakening the financial resources of one or the other, might be too hot a political potato, even in the pursuit of faster broadband.\nBT's share price reaction might turn out to be overdone. Ms White plans to enforce the separation by introducing not only a new board to run Openreach, but also new articles of association that will give directors a duty to serve customers of the network as much as the company's owners.\nThis holds out an obvious prospect of conflicts to come, and runs counter to the normal assumption that in private companies, the shareholder is king.\nIt also carries an echo of the \"golden shares\" held by the government in Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems, two companies judged important for the defence of the realm. In each case, the golden share is actually enshrined by specific articles of association that give directors and the government powers beyond those normally enjoyed by company boards.\nBT's chief executive, Gavin Patterson, said he thought he could reach a compromise with Ofcom, but admitted they would need to see the detail of the new articles.\nIf they prove too much at odds with BT's own desire to control Openreach - which it will still own - get ready for a court battle and perhaps, eventually, a full break-up.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "The reaction from BT's investors told us much about media regulator Ofcom's ruling on the fate of Openreach, the BT subsidiary that provides much of the UK's broadband infrastructure.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Prof Robert Paterson, from the University of Texas, Austin, says that he learned this the hard way under the administration of George W Bush, another president cool on climate.\n\"Within a month of coming into office the EPA website went down for three weeks and when it went back up stuff wasn't available anymore,\" Prof Paterson told BBC News.\n\"If history repeats itself with another administration that is basically a naysayer to climate change science, I would say it would be prudent for folks to do what they can to keep as much as they can on mirror sites.\"\nOther scientists are concerned about nominations to key government areas such as former Texas governor Rick Perry at Department of Energy (DoE) and Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt at the EPA. Both have heavily criticised the agencies they now lead.\nAttempts by the Trump transition team at the DoE to obtain a list of all those employees who had worked on climate change have provoked anger as well as fear.\n\"I was horrified by the report with regard to Department of Energy scientists being named.  We must stand up to that and I have said so. We are all DoE scientists in that regard,\" said Dr Kevin Trenberth who has been a lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a senior scientist at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).\n\"That is a pretty chilling action by an incoming administration - the rhetoric suggests that revenge is a valid response to people who disagree with you,\" said Prof Robert Paterson,\nThe Energy department has refused to comply with the request and the Trump team has now said the questionnaire was \"not authorised\".\nMany researchers are worried that the anti-climate tone being struck by the incoming administration will have many serious consequences for scientists trying to do their jobs in real world situations.\n\"Flooding is a fact of life in Texas and the frequency with which we're seeing it is noticeably increasing,\" said Dr Shannon Van Zandt, at Texas A&M University.\n\"A lot of the tools that have been developed by Federal agencies have been designed to help communities predict the changes that they're going to see and if that is restricted we would lose the ability to help people understand and incorporate it into the decisions that they're making both at the local level and at the state policy level.\"\nBut some in this field believe that the change of administration is a good moment to review the type of scientific questions that US researchers are asking.\nMarcel Crok is a Dutch science writer who doesn't support the scientific consensus on climate change. He says that much of the research in the field takes place in an echo chamber and he welcomes the fact that the Trump administration will challenge this.\nMr Crok accepts that human emissions of carbon dioxide are warming the planet, but he questions the accepted view on how far and how rapidly temperatures will rise.

He has had shingles and an elbow problem, and now his left hip is proving cause for concern.\nOpting out of two scheduled exhibition matches at the Hurlingham Club in London may not be too much of a blow, as Murray's aptitude for grass is likely to allow him some margin for error during the opening week at Wimbledon. But will he be in pain, and will his movement suffer?\nAlthough it was reassuring to see him return to the practice courts on Friday, Murray was walking with a limp and neither moving, nor hitting his backhand, anywhere near as well as he will need to. Only time will tell.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nMurray has looked especially vulnerable this season over three sets.\nAs well as the defeat by Thompson at Queen's, he has also lost in straight sets to Fabio Fognini in Rome (no disgrace), to Borna Coric in Madrid, and to world number 129 Vasek Pospisil at Indian Wells.\nThough he was bamboozled by Mischa Zverev in the fourth round of the Australian Open, his Grand Slam record remains formidable. He is aiming this fortnight for a 10th consecutive Wimbledon quarter-final, and the last time he failed to reach the second week of a Slam was when he fell to Stan Wawrinka in the third round of the 2010 US Open.\nSo, assuming Murray's hip does not leave him underpowered, the French Open provides the best indication as to how he might fare at Wimbledon.\nMurray often started slowly in matches at Roland Garros, but put in a dominant third-round performance against Juan Martin del Potro as he won in straight sets. He never looked a realistic champion, but ultimately was just a tie-break away from a second consecutive final. He then ran out of steam, a legacy of insufficient matches, in a Stan Wawrinka-dominated final set of their semi-final.\nIt would be foolish to try to come to a firm conclusion about Murray's chances at the All England Club this year. Twice a champion, and a gold-medal winner on Centre Court at the 2012 Olympics, not even Novak Djokovic has outperformed him at Wimbledon over the past five years.\nYet on 2017 results alone, Murray is only the seventh best player in the field.\nHe has too frequently struggled to impose himself on his opponent, and hindered at times by injury, has not been able to trust his serve in the same way.\nThis year he has won 72% of points on first serve, down from 76% last year; and while last year he saved 66% of the break points he faced, that number has fallen this year to 54%.\nHe claims his indifferent form is nothing to do with the pressure associated with his status as world number one, and he does not cut the figure of a man weighed down by an unwelcome burden.\nBut perhaps Murray has lost his cause: he is now the hunted, rather than the hunter.\nThat may not be a concern much longer.\nMurray is virtually 5,000 points behind Rafael Nadal in the season-long race and is therefore very likely to be replaced at the top of the rankings by the autumn at the latest.\nIn fact, he could be overtaken after Wimbledon by Wawrinka or Djokovic if they win the title, but more probably by Nadal, who assuming both reach the second week would only have to go one round further.\nNadal's knees, Djokovic's blues and Wawrinka's unexceptional Wimbledon record muddy the waters still further.\nAnd then there's Roger Federer: the seven-time champion, who is free of injuries, and last Sunday in Halle won his fourth title of the year having skipped the clay-court season.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Of his last 30 matches in 2016, Andy Murray won 28 and lost just two.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Cate Blanchett plays the stepmother and Helena Bonham Carter is the fairy godmother.\n\"Keeping it classic is the twist,\" says Branagh, who started his directing career in 1989 with his adaptation of Shakespeare's Henry V.\n\"I always felt that it's better to do a modern version of a story using the historical perspective, than say, make a story of Cinderella in Brooklyn in 2015.\n\"I find that when you try and update Shakespeare to a contemporary setting too, you always pay a price.\n\"In this case, the original material of Cinderella is far richer than my ideas, so it seems to me that it's my job to make it simple. Just let the fairytale speak, because it affects us in a more complicated way than we think.\n\"Audiences have already come up to me saying the film is about patchwork families, about child bereavement, about the politics between women these days. Fairytales are a psychological brain-worm that need to be left alone to do their work.\"\nHelena Bonham Carter says that at first she was dubious \"as to whether a straight version would work\".\n\"I think it's a really good film, but it could so easily have been bad. I was saying: 'So you're really going to do a completely straight version of Cinderella? No gimmicks, no extra frills, no 3D?'\n\"It's very classic, but they know me, and they allowed me not to be that straight in my own role.\"\nJust as audiences seem to have taken to the film, critics such as the Guardian's Guy Lodge comment that \"while it might have been nice to see the new-model Cinderella follow Frozen's progressive, quasi-feminist lead, the film's naff, preserved-in-amber romanticism is its very charm\".\nBut James disagrees that this Cinderella is an old-fashioned heroine, pointing out that at the start of Disney's 1950 classic, Cinderella \"is staring out of the window dreaming of the prince and waiting for him to rescue her\".\n\"This Cinderella doesn't do that at all. I think we make it very clear that everything she does is her choice - even deciding to stay on at her parents' house with such wicked treatment from her stepmother.\n\"She is told by her dying mother to 'have courage and be kind' and this is the film's, and Cinderella's, backbone.\"\nThis is the first major leading role for Surrey-born James. \"Not even a big TV series like Downton could prepare me for this fuss,\" she says.\n\"I am getting slightly carried away. I keep seeing giant posters of me all over the place in a big blue dress and people shouting my name.\n\"I'm trying to enjoy the magic actually - this is the fairytale aspect of it for me, personally. It's quite something that so many little girls are going to think I'm Cinderella.\"\nJames has dismissed speculation that her waist had been digitally altered to make it smaller as \"irrelevant\", claiming that fans were interested in Cinderella because of her \"morals\".\nCate Blanchett agrees that the core of the film is \"kindness\", adding that it is \"an unusual quality these days. There's not a cynical bone in this film's body and that's its strength.\n\"There is cruelty and jealousy in the movie too, but too often we don't value kindness. In today's world you think someone who is kind is a doormat, and the fact this triumphs is really heart-warming.\"\nBranagh, who previously directed Marvel's Thor, describes kindness \"as its own super-power. It is a dark world and children do need to understand they need courage and resilience to get through it.\n\"People often compare the story of Shakespeare's King Lear in relation to Cinderella. There is a resemblance there - a father making a tragic error and three daughters; great cruelty and great kindness.\n\"This film is all about the difficult but simple choice to be good and kind. Whether you're dealing with Shakespeare or the great fairy stories, they are all great big metaphors for human nature.\n\"And regardless of what happens to this film version, I believe this is why the tale of Cinderella will keep enduring.\"\nCinderella is out in the UK on 27 March.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "In recent years, Hollywood remakes and re-imaginings of classic fairytales have come thick and fast - all darker, more adult versions of tales that originally appeared in cinemas.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

This was my dream. When the final decision was taken I didn't believe it. But unfortunately, this is the reality.\"\n\"I think it's a stupid reaction,\" Russian MP Vitaly Milonov tells me. \"They're even afraid of such a small girl to enter Kiev.\"\nEven before Ukraine's ban, Mr Milonov had called for a Russian boycott of Eurovision: \"Eurovision became a disgusting socialist nightmare for all these left-wing parties with all their bearded women, or men, with these anti-Christian positions.\n\"I am sure that most conservatives in the world will never attend this festival. Because this is a festival of Sodom and Gomorrah.\"\nIt is supposed to be a festival of peace and friendship but there is not much sign of either in relations between Kiev and Moscow.\nIn eastern Ukraine, 10,000 people have been killed in three years of war: a war in which Russia is directly involved through its military support for separatist rebels. Crimea remains a source of tension and Eurovision is the latest battleground.\n\"Since 2014, we've had a law in Ukraine that punishes people who illegally cross our border when they visit Crimea,\" says Ukrainian MP Olha Chervakova.\n\"Did Russia know this? Of course. Did Russia know that Julia Samoilova would fall foul of this law? Of course. In other words, entering her in the contest was a conscious provocation to create a huge political scandal.\"\nThe ban created a huge headache for Eurovision organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).\nEurovision's Executive Supervisor Jon Ola Sand said in March that Ukraine's decision went \"against both the spirit of the contest and the notion of inclusivity that lies at the heart of its values\".\nIn an unprecedented move, the EBU offered Russia the chance to take part by satellite from Moscow.\nRussia declined: after the dramas of last year's Eurovision, Moscow was in no mood to compromise.\nUkraine's 2016 winning entry, 1944, sung by Jamala, was about Joseph Stalin's deportation of Crimea's Tatar population.\nRussia had argued that Jamala's song broke contest rules for being of a political nature. When it won, Moscow cried foul and said there was politics at play. Now Russia seems determined to make not only Ukraine look bad, but the entire Eurovision Song Contest.\nWhen strangers are coming, they come to your house, they kill you and say 'we're not guilty'\nRecently, two Russian pranksters - posing as Ukraine's prime minister and his assistant - released online a telephone conversation they had recorded with a woman they claimed was EBU Director General Ingrid Deltenre.\nIf this is the voice of the EBU's top official, it is hugely embarrassing for the EBU, because the woman on the recording makes an astonishing admission about Ukraine's winning song: \"I was just too late made aware of the song.\n\"If I would have been earlier, and I think it was on purpose, I would have not allowed the song to participate, to be very transparent.\"\nIn a statement, the EBU said it would \"not comment on prank calls\".\nBut these are high-profile Russian pranksters, who once fooled Elton John into thinking he was talking to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\"Now our people don't trust Eurovision any more,\" one of the pranksters, Alexei, told me. \"People understand that any country can use their political goals to win, so it's not a fair contest anymore.\"\nPerhaps this is not just about a song contest? Or Russia's relations with Ukraine?\nEquating Eurovision with Sodom and Gomorrah and embarrassing the EBU appear part of a wider pattern of Russia trying to undermine Western institutions and Western liberal ideas.\n\"Russia now defines itself in its social and societal model against the West,\" believes Jan Techau of the Richard Holbrooke Forum at the American Academy in Berlin. \"The Kremlin explicitly portrays Russian society as a counter model to the corrupted West. They seem now to buy completely into the idea that whatever harms the West is good for Russia: a classic zero-sum game.\"\nIn the run-up to this year's contest, singer Jamala warned that \"we should expect more provocations [from Russia] because our victory hurt them a lot.\"\nSecurity in Kiev is tight ahead of the first semi-final.\nAs for Julia Samoilova, instead of singing at Eurovision this week, she will be performing - once again - in Crimea.

The public went down one flight of stone stairs and then there were three long arches.\n\"At the end of one of the long arches was a little tiny stage. That's where the Beatles performed 292 times.\n\"I remember it being very highly charged with excitement. The music sounded even more exciting [than the previous gigs] because The Cavern was this little squashed space so the music sounded a bit louder, a bit more exciting and a bit more vital. About 20 to 30 people were there.\n\"The Beatles were the complete package - they didn't just have a great singer, they had two great singers. They always did harmonies right from the very first time I saw them.\n\"They could probably only afford two microphones, and so when one was doing the lead singing the other two were facing each other on the mic, and it was quite charismatic, it was nice to look at. They had a camaraderie about them.\n\"I never heard them singing one of their own songs because they were just a straight covers band at that time, as was everybody else in Liverpool.\n\"The standard songs that they sang - them and the other bands in Liverpool - were [by] Chuck Berry, Little Richard, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly. The sound that I very clearly remember the Beatles playing in the Cavern was a Chuck Berry riff.\n\"As well as doing the stock standards, the Beatles were a bit different because they were better at playing complicated chords. The Beatles were a bit more adventurous.\n\"It wasn't just the music and the singing, it was their lack of respect for the audience. At the Cavern for those first few gigs, they were quite irreverent to the audience and other people. They were sort of the first punk band. The Beatles were a law unto themselves on the stage.\n\"They were still doing that when they went to America - if someone asked them a question they didn't give a serious answer, and that's how they behaved on stage in the Cavern, and that's why I think they liked it in the Cavern.\n\"They were the epitome of rebellion in Liverpool because they weren't trying to imitate Cliff Richard and the Shadows doing little in time steps. They would dance out of step on purpose.\n\"That was their purpose in life - to upset the apple cart. They were so cheeky and so entertaining all around. They were a little bit of a voice for us against authority. I think they were rebels. We were mini rebels supporting them.\n\"Of course when I went back to work I used to stand gazing out of the window thinking about the Beatles and the girls at the Cavern. I couldn't really concentrate on doing any work.\n\"Just in a few weeks they'd gained a bigger following. When word went around, the crowd grew and people kept coming back. Once you'd seen them, not many people didn't go to see them again.\n\"They had big long queues, right down the length of the street and even round the corner at the bottom. But at that stage I'd dumped them.\n\"They started talking about going to London and making records and things like that. Betrayal.\n\"I wasn't the only one. I think the ones who thought that they'd discovered them were a little clique and really did give up on them when the masses found them. It was only when I heard Love Me Do on the radio that I started getting interested in them again. My wife subsequently bought all the LPs but that first era of The Beatles was over for me.\"\nAlex McKechnie was speaking to BBC News entertainment reporter Ian Youngs.\nThe Cavern is celebrating the anniversary with a series of tribute events on Wednesday.

To his ardent fans, he was a true revolutionary impelled by a great sense of mission to overturn the residual feudal and Stalinist structures of the ancient regime.\nHe was the outsider whose genius led to the overthrow of an entrenched and deeply loathed dictatorship.\nHis message of social justice and modernisation resonated with many in the homeland, especially the marginalised \"lowlanders\" in Oromia and Ogadenia.\nHis concept of revolutionary democracy and ethnic federalism promised to create a fairer and inclusive order.\nMeasured against these lofty and progressive ideals, his record has, at best, been patchy and rather uninspiring.\nThe much-vaunted ambitious economic modernisation and liberalisation programme has created a new middle class, attracted huge foreign investment, spawned massive infrastructure projects, spurred economic growth and generally transformed the skylines of the major cities such as Addis Ababa and Mekele.\nBut it has not tackled the deep structural and systemic problems and inefficiencies that have hampered real growth. The Stalinist land tenure system and the complex bureaucratic system are still intact, and the vast majority remain trapped in poverty.\nThe democratisation and political reform process, which Mr Meles himself termed \"work in progress\", has long stalled.\nSince the disputed May 2005 polls, the regime has increasingly become intolerant and autocratic, using a raft of new legislation to stifle and criminalise dissent and lock up opponents.\nWhy West will miss Meles\nObituary: Meles Zenawi\nLife in pictures: Ethiopia's Meles Zenawi\nA plethora of old and new armed ethnic factions continue to wage low-level insurgencies in the periphery. The new policy of engagement and piecemeal peace pacts with a select few has so far only succeeded in managing the problem and buying the regime more time.\nFeeling vulnerable and insecure, Mr Meles has in the last few years become a leader whose overriding domestic political manoeuvres and calculations are driven by one instinct: regime survival.\nHe orchestrated a discreet purge of the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and the administration, demoting, sidelining or reassigning key potential rivals and opponents.\nHis death has certainly created a leadership vacuum at the top and with no clear figure groomed to succeed him, the battle for succession could prove destabilising.\nThat said, the prospect of a large-scale upheaval, as some fear, is highly unlikely, partly because the country has a powerful, highly disciplined and cohesive army and security apparatus.\nThe opposition can, in theory, capitalise on the disarray within the ruling party to advance its goals and press for an early poll, but that looks difficult given the narrow factionalism and disorganisation within its ranks, not to mention the fact most of the influential opposition figures are either in exile or locked up.\nMr Meles has continued to enjoy good press in the region and across much of Africa, even as his stature diminished domestically.\nHe is hugely admired and many seem prepared to overlook his personal frailties and forgive his leadership shortcomings for one simple reason: no other African leader has in recent times deployed such great intellectual energy and firepower and used his diplomatic talent and influence to articulate the continent's key priorities and demands at global forums.\nHe did put Africa on the map, and as a skilled and effective negotiator and spokesman he certainly forced leaders in the developed world to listen. But whether this feat alone qualifies him to join the pantheon of the continent's great visionaries, like Kwame Nkrumah and Nelson Mandela, remains debatable.\nNot in contention though is the fact that the late prime minister - almost single-handedly - transformed Ethiopia from a deeply conflicted and war-wracked peripheral Horn of Africa state into a supremely self-assured African diplomatic and military powerhouse.\nFrom the mid-1990s and up until 2005, Ethiopia was a key stop for high-level Western dignitaries visiting the continent, and Mr Meles the must-see African leader whose advice and counsel was sought.\nMany embraced him as a reformer and an elite member of the so-called \"new breed\" of African leaders.\nThe Ethiopian leader cultivated the new friendship and used it to forge strategic partnerships to raise his country's profile and advance its geopolitical and strategic national interests.\nHe swiftly rebuilt and modernised the army, initially in a bid to achieve parity with Sudan and negotiate a detente from a position of strength, but subsequently to \"tame\" a belligerent Eritrea, with whom relations had began to dramatically deteriorate a few years after its independence in 1991.\nThe two countries have since fought two bloody and costly border wars beginning from 1998. A peace pact and a border arbitration treaty brokered by international mediators failed to end to conflict permanently, partly because Addis Ababa refused to fully abide by the terms of the accords and to return the tiny barren piece of land awarded to Eritrea.\nHostilities have continued to simmer ever since, and periodic flare-ups are common along the volatile border.\nIt is plausible the death of Mr Meles may - far from creating opportunities for dialogue - spur Eritrea into escalating the tension.\nThat would be a disastrous and risky gamble which Eritrea must be dissuaded from taking. It is unlikely this is a course of action that would help it secure its perceived legitimate rights, much less win it friends in the region and beyond.\nIn Somalia, Ethiopia's military presence in the past year has been instrumental in putting the pressure on the militant group al-Shabab. Thousands of Ethiopian troops now control a number of key strategic areas in south-central Somalia.\nThe death of Mr Meles has raised new anxieties among the regional allies with troops in Somalia.\nThere are growing fears a destabilising succession battle and power struggle in Addis could potentially complicate matters and jeopardise the whole mission. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga said as much in a recent radio interview.\nSuch fears are understandable, considering Ethiopia's history and political fragility.\nHowever, there is hope too the country has achieved a level of maturity and that it has the institutional mechanisms and the structural resilience to weather the current storm and ensure a smooth transition that allows for policy continuity in Somalia.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "The death of Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has thrown the populous Horn of Africa giant into a period of deep uncertainty and created a serious leadership vacuum in the region with profound geopolitical implications.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Yesterday the US administration, without presenting any facts, any evidence, announced a new wave of sanctions against Russia.\"\nMaria Zakharova, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, in a post on Facebook headlined 'Obama's Coming Out'\n\"The people who have lived eight years in the White House are not an administration but a group of vindictive, unimaginative, foreign policy failures. Today [US President Barack] Obama admitted this officially.\n\"Most surprising of all is that after failing to record any achievements in the international arena in the history of his presidency, the Nobel laureate has managed to sign off not with a flourish, but a blot...\n\"Today America, the American people, has been humiliated by its own president.

There are no fees for Scottish students in Scotland and the Institute for Fiscal Studies says scrapping the lower fees charged in Northern Ireland and Wales would cost a further \u00a3500m per year.\nThis would be covered by the \u00a348.6bn that Labour's manifesto says will be raised by tax changes - along with the party's other spending commitments.\nBut there are lower estimates.\nLabour's figure is based on replacing the fees currently paid by students.\nBut the IFS and London Economics say the cost to the Treasury could be lower, when written off loans are taken into account, with forecasts around \u00a37.5bn to \u00a38bn.\nLabour's big move on fees represents a complete of direction. Previously in government, Labour raised fees and in opposition proposed a modest reduction.\nBut they are now proposing to bulldoze the apparatus of fees, loans and repayments.\nThe most recent figures show \u00a376bn is owed in student loans in England - with this level of student debt having almost doubled in four years.\nFrom this autumn, fees will begin increasing every year with inflation and will soon glide past the \u00a310,000 mark, with interest charges also rising to 6.1%.\nAnd the Conservative government, before the election, had announced plans to sell off student debt to private investors.\nUnder Labour's plans, this whole push towards marketisation would be ditched - and universities would return to being directly funded by government.\nBut is there any evidence that getting rid of fees would help more young people into university, including the disadvantaged?\nUniversities are worried that such a switch to direct funding, dependent on government finances, would put a limit on places and a brake on expansion.\nOne of the quiet revolutions of recent years has been the complete removal of limits on student numbers - with universities able to recruit as many students as they can accommodate - and opening the door to rising numbers of graduates.\nThe argument for fees has always been that they provide the funding to allow more young people to go to university - and that a much smaller proportion went to university when there were no fees.\nThis year has seen a fall of 5% in university applications from UK students - and it follows a pattern of dips when fees are increased.\nBut the long-term trend has been relentlessly upwards, with a huge growth in demand for university places. It remains a powerful symbol of family aspiration.\nAlthough wealthy families remain much more likely to send their children to university - entry rates have risen across all social classes, including the poorest.\nDo students get value for money from tuition fees? Is this an investment that is repaid in better job prospects?\nDepartment for Education figures published last month showed that graduates remained more likely to be in a job than non-graduates and on average earned \u00a310,000 per year more.\nAmong younger people, this graduate advantage is less, at \u00a36,000 per year.\nBut the figures also showed that, despite rises in fees, graduate salaries have stagnated over the past decade.\nLabour's plan sends a strong political signal to young voters.\nA survey from the Higher Education Policy Institute, taken before the manifesto publication, suggested that Labour is now more popular among students than it was in any of the three previous general elections.\nThe survey found Labour significantly ahead in the student vote.\nThe Liberal Democrats, once the most popular party for students, are trailing in third behind the Conservatives.\nIs this still the cloud of tuition fees hanging over the Lib Dems from their U-turn during the coalition government?\nCould they really entirely scrap fees?\nThere will be plenty of scrutiny over funding Labour's plans. But there is nothing unprecedented or outlandish about getting rid of fees.\nGermany has phased out tuition fees - and universities in the Netherlands and Scandinavia try to recruit students from England with the offer of low or no fees.\nFrench undergraduates can study for low fees.\nIn the United States, New York state is introducing free fees for students from families earning up to about \u00a3100,000 per year, offering a handout to the squeezed middle classes.\nThere are now leading universities in the US which have lower tuition fees than in England. The University of Washington charges less than the University of Wolverhampton.\nAnd the most immediate example of getting rid of fees has been in Scotland.\nFor England's voters, Labour's undiluted policy on tuition fees - proposing their complete abolition - offers the sharpest divide in the road for decades.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Scrapping tuition fees in England is the biggest and most expensive proposal in Labour's \u00a325bn worth of pledges for education.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

She developed an extreme fear of death, and this can precipitate her panic attacks.\nDuring an attack, Emma feels terrified, and can often scream out loud.\nIt is extremely worrying for her family and can be scary to onlookers.\nEmma has tried various medications and counselling therapies but was still struggling and getting three to four panic attacks per day.\nOne of the ways in which I helped her was by changing her food choices.\nDespite being sceptical at first, I was able to show Emma the hidden power of food in helping her mental state.\n\"I had been living on a diet of takeaways, fizzy drinks and general processed and convenience foods for as long as I can remember, and didn't for one moment think that what I ate was contributing in any way to the anxiety and panic attacks I'd been experiencing for years,\" she said.\n\"Since meeting and spending time with Dr Rangan, he has changed my entire outlook on food, and why certain foods were potentially having a negative impact on my mental health.\n\"I now only buy and cook with fresh food, I make my own stocks, I eat plenty of fish and I try to reduce the amount of sugar I consume.\n\"I feel so much better and intend to keep this up.\"\nThe evidence of food's link to mental states has been growing.\nA landmark 2015 article in the prestigious Lancet journal stated that nutrition may be as important to mental health as it is to cardiology, endocrinology and gastroenterology.\nPlus, a small but important interventional Australian study from earlier this year showed that a modified Mediterranean diet significantly helped many patients with severe depression within 12 weeks.\nUnfortunately, this has not translated into routine patient care and most doctors still do not discuss food with their mental health patients.\nThis has to change.\nMany of us do not think about how food can impact the way we feel, but we all know the feeling of using food as a quick pick-me-up.\nWhen we are feeling a little tired, a little stressed or a little low, we often reach for a sugary snack to help us feel good in the short term.\nBut, this can actually make things worse in the long term.\nThe food you are eating is literally \"shocking\" your body.\nBy changing her diet, as well as reducing her alcohol intake, Emma experienced a reduction in anxiety, an improvement in mood and fewer panic attacks.\nShe also described feeling mentally stronger, having a clearer head, more energy and a greater ability to cope with stress.\nIt has also encouraged her to be more active and do more things at weekends, which also helps her mental health.\nOf course, there can be many other factors to consider with mental health problems and it is always worth getting advice from a qualified healthcare professional.\nThere can be many other important factors to consider with mental health problems, such as emotional trauma and stress, but we should not underestimate the power of changing our food to improve our mood.\nAs a doctor, I like to empower my patients. Here are four of the tips that helped Emma, that can also help you:\n1. Reduce sugar and processed foods\nSugar, food that contains sugar, or even food that is converted quickly into sugar, such as many breakfast cereals, cause your blood sugar to rapidly rise.\nWithin two to three hours your sugar levels then start to fall.\nAt this point, you may not only feel hungry, you can feel \"h-angry\" as well - hungry and angry.\nLow and falling blood sugar levels can cause a rise in your body's stress hormones, cortisol and adrenaline.\nThis can have a negative impact on your mood.\n2. Increase your intake of Omega-3 fats\nThis is an essential nutrient for brain function and may protect against anxiety and other psychiatric disorders.\nFoods high in Omega-3 fats include fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, anchovies), grass-fed meat, seeds and leafy vegetables.\n3. Eat more tryptophan-containing foods like pork, chicken, seeds and walnuts\nTryptophan is an amino acid the body converts into serotonin, your feel-good neurotransmitter.\nEat them with a healthy carbohydrate source such as sweet potatoes, which helps to transport more tryptophan into your blood.\n4. Feed your gut bugs\nSome scientists refer to the trillions of gut bugs that live inside us, the gut microbiota, as the brain's peacekeepers.\nIt is thought that having a healthy population of gut bugs can have a significant influence on your mood via the gut-brain axis.\nThe prebiotic fibre contained in vegetables help your gut bugs to proliferate, so the best way to maintain a healthy population is to increase your intake of vegetables, as well as fermented foods such as sauerkraut.\nBest options are leeks, onions, garlic, artichokes and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower.\nYou have the ability to improve the way you feel by controlling what you put on your plate.\nSee how food can impact mental health on Doctor in the House, Monday, 21:00 BST on BBC One.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Approximately one in four of us will experience a mental health problem each year in England.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The ex-wife of Pakistani cricketer and politician Imran Khan also appeared to criticise her brother's campaign.\nThe New York Times describes Mr Khan's victory as \"striking\" and leads with the fact that he is London's first Muslim mayor. It described London as a city with an acute shortage of affordable homes and a creaking, overcrowded mass transit network.\nA commentary in German news magazine Der Spiegel describes Mr Khan's win as a \"victory over Islamophobia\", and says London is breaking new ground. \"The mayoral election shows that London is more liberal, clever and tolerant than the Conservative mudslingers would like to think,\" it says.\nQatari daily Al-Sharq says: \"Once again, the British capital enters history, this time through the gate of democratic victory by electing a Muslim of immigrant descent as its mayor.\"\nPakistan's Dawn newspaper says that Khan should see himself as a role model for millions of Muslims living in Europe.\nWith the rise of increasingly popular right-wing parties across the continent, the paper's Brussels correspondent Shada Islam writes that \"Khan's story should help set the record straight on immigration, integration and European Muslims\".\nHistory Professor Juan Cole points out that Mr Khan is by no means the first Muslim in charge of a European city.

And she's not wrong.\nThe follow-up to her Mercury Prize-nominated debut, 2013's Sing To The Moon, is imminent. Second album The Dreaming Room is due in June and her newest track Phenomenal Woman has just debuted as Annie Mac's hottest record on BBC Radio 1.\n\"And then we have probably the most important live moment on TV in this country today,\" she adds.\n\"It's all potentially extremely exciting - and that just means that I'm naturally terrified.\"\nThe singer's struggles with stage fright and anxiety are well-documented and live TV is a particular fear.\nDescribing the concept as \"just hellish\", she tells us: \"I'd rather die. That's how I feel sometimes - I think, 'if I dropped dead I wouldn't have to do it!'.\"\nSo, it's perhaps surprising that the singer let us tag along as she kicked off the new series of Later... with Jools Holland. But it seems BBC Two's esteemed music show has a special place in her heart.\n\"In the musician's world, you say 'Jools Holland' and all of a sudden you've got massive respect - it's like saying you got Glastonbury.\"\nHer third time on Later... she calls respected musician and presenter Holland a \"genuine champion\".\n\"He called me this afternoon just to say that he'd been listening to my new record and he wanted to tell me specifically what song and what parts and why.\n\"I tell you, in the TV world, it's not the kind of place where there's room for those kind of genuine interactions, just because there's so much pressure on everyone. It's very special.\"\nHere the diary of Laura's day.\nTour manager Paul picks us up in sunny east London. Laura's assistant Mariama is laden with popcorn and snacks as we pile into the silver Mercedes van bound for the studios in Kent. The singer takes some me-time behind her shades, safe in the knowledge it's going to be a long day.\n\"I'm such a weird person to be around before anything big,\" she admits.\n\"I can't normally talk, so my team tend to just leave me to it, but I'll pick up.\n\"Right now I want to be jumping up, but you don't want to celebrate before the main event, so I'm just trying to be as relaxed as I can.\"\nWe arrive to the sounds of Kano and his brass section sound-checking. He's on the bill along with Paul Simon, The Coral, Jason Isbell and Lake Street Dive.\nLaura has the honour of opening and closing both the live and pre-recorded shows, something she says she's \"glad you only find out on the day\".\n\"I'm doing Phenomenal Woman, Kiss My Feet - which the Jools team requested - and Overcome, the first single, which featured Nile Rogers.\n\"I wanted to explode back onto the scene with something that was captivating in a much rawer and darker way. That's why there's dance and so much movement this time around, and why it's such a visual album.\"\nBackstage the band are split across two dressing rooms - one for the boys and one for the girls, where we're quickly made welcome as they debate which of the many black items of clothing they've brought will get worn.\n\"There's nine of us - it's huge by pop terms, but I refused to compromise,\" says Laura.\n\"With Sing To The Moon, six of us were trying to sound like an orchestra and a choir. It was a stress.\n\"My sister Dionne went from violin to guitar - literally learnt the guitar [and] is killing it - my brother's playing cello. It feels much more like a band than me trying to do the solo artist thing. We feel like a really solid family.\"\nStill in her fur-lined boots and denim dress from the journey, Laura and the band head to the camera rehearsal. Jools arrives and gives Laura a hug, waving hello to the production team. Giant white cue cards are being written to help him introduce the acts.\nRunning through each of their tracks twice, Laura sports her new keytar in place of her trademark piano.\n\"Lady Mariama was up until 4am trying to make my keytar white. I mean what the hell is that about?\" she laughs.\n\"Initially it was a joke idea, I was just messing about jamming with it, but it made so much sense. I'm not stuck behind anything in a static way anymore, I can move and I can see people. If I want to turn and feel the band I can do that. We have such a good time now.\"\nTime for some nourishment. The team (\"there's like millions of them... making it work\") are handed pocket money for the canteen, while Laura retreats to her dressing room. As well as make-up, wardrobe and calming those nerves, she also has a TV interview to fit in.\n\"I used to not eat, I couldn't eat. But I've learned to, so you don't drop off after one song. I have meatballs and sweet potato fries. And a balance of water and red wine.\"\n\"[Designer] Alex Noble has done a lot of my clothes recently,\" says Laura. \"He is just on another planet. He text me yesterday and I was just weeping emojis because the clothes are just... I mean you'll see with the outfit tonight.\n\"I made a visual essay for the album, this massive book [filled with] images, as stimulus for new music but also to help anybody I might be collaborating with. Stylists or people in the label, anyone could take the book and go 'oh yeah, I'm listening and I'm looking'.\n\"It means I get to talk less. That's probably surprising to some people because I do love to natter! But it helps.\"\nMinutes before show time, Laura's designer and assistant are still huddled together in one of the dressing rooms with a needle and thread and the singer's fabulous outfit in their hands.\nShe's set to do an interview at Jools's famous piano, but the purple corset she'll be wearing (with matching super-flared trousers) will be too tight to sit down in. Cue furious unpicking and re-stitching. Eventually it's decided she'll do the interview standing up. Problem solved.\nWith the audience in place and schooled on how to cheer and clap in the correct manner, Laura's up first - opening the pre-recorded show with Maya Angelou-inspired anthem Phenomenal Woman.\n\"If you're first out of the blocks - you're the thing in the room that makes the first sound. I've been second and third before and everybody breathes when the sound's been made,\" says Laura.\nThere's mild panic when the lighting desk freezes after The Coral perform, but after a few minutes of confusion they're rolling again.\nLater, a respectful hush descends as Paul Simon performs Sounds Of Silence in the centre of the studio.\n\"He made me cry so much,\" says Laura. \"I kept thinking, 'why didn't I bring Mum to this gig?'. She was raised on Simon and Garfunkel.\n\"I ended up thinking about my whole life, my creative life... what is this all about? Here I am literally stood in front of Mr Paul Simon.\"\nWith all the stars limbered up (and the shortest of toilet breaks), the second show goes live on BBC Two.\n\"It's an amazing feeling because you know that it's happening now and everybody's tuned in, but at the same time - the fear and the dread. You can't correct anything, so whatever comes out is it. \"\nLaura ends the live show on a high with Phenomenal Woman.\n\"That for me was surprisingly wonderful, because live television literally - there's nothing that I'm more terrified of! And the live performance was better than the pre-record - what?!\"\nIt's all over. The audience files out and the set's dismantled as artists and their teams pack up their gear and rush to congratulate each other.\nUS outfit Lake Street Dive collar Laura for a picture, while she and sister Dionne seek out Kano for a snap (\"Because he's fine. And obviously amazing\").\n\"I always forget how emotionally exhausting it is,\" says Laura.\n\"The amount I invest into any performance is always bucket loads of sweat or tension that doesn't get released until I'm in that moment.\n\"That's the uniqueness of a show like Jools's - you are getting that concentrated performance.\"\nSo what now?\n\"Everybody laughs at me because I literally make a beeline for my bed after. I'll probably eat again later because I always get a major appetite, which is why I have this thing [grabs belly area] that will never go away.\n\"But yeah, I just conk out. If I think about stuff I'll go nuts, because you've just put something out.\n\"I mean I haven't had a child, but I imagine - like when you have a baby - it's out there. I can't push it back in!\"\nYou can catch the extended edition of Later... with Jools Holland on BBC Two on Friday 22 April at 23:15 BST or watch Tuesday night's live episode on the iPlayer now.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "We go behind the scenes with singer Laura Mvula as she prepares to debut her new material and kick off the 48th series of Later... with Jools Holland.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Kaino was sin-binned for kicking the ball away and Pollard stroked over his fourth penalty to make it 12-7 at the interval, the green-shirted supporters in the capacity crowd starting to believe that the upset was on.\nThe Springboks had not lost to the All Blacks in 21 Tests when leading or level at half-time, but despite being a man down New Zealand closed the gap to two points as a spell of carefully worked territory was capped with a Carter drop-goal.\nSchalk Burger then lost the ball metres from his own line, the All Blacks went right and drove on through their forwards before Ma'a Nonu sent replacement Barrett diving into the corner.\nWith Habana sin-binned for knocking the ball from scrum-half Aaron Smith's hands and Carter bending over the conversion for 17-12, the match appeared to have turned.\nPollard and Carter exchanged penalties, and with replacements pouring on to the pitch and the rain hammering down the two heavyweights went toe to toe.\nPat Lambie came on for Pollard to make it 20-18 with 10 minutes to go, and an air of desperation was apparent in both sides.\nCarter sprinted half the length of the pitch to clear from De Allende, South Africa failed to capitalise from an attacking line-out and New Zealand escaped into opposition territory as the seconds crawled by, running the clock down with a series of drives to celebrate with exhaustion at the end.\nBen Smith was faultless under the high ball and Dan Carter's decision-making once again peerless.\nHowever, for his muscular, repeated carrying in a relentlessly physical match and the superb run and timing of pass for Beauden Barrettt's critical second-half try, Ma'a Nonu deserves the honour.\nNew Zealand coach Steve Hansen: \"It was always going to be close, they're a great side and they showed that again. I was really proud of our guys, they kept their composure.\n\"We just needed to come out for the second half and start taking the game to them rather than waiting for them to take it to us. We talked about it at half-time. We talked about keeping composure and talked about winning the first 10 minutes.\"\nSouth Africa coach Heyneke Meyer: \"Our discipline in the second half was just not good enough. They coped better with the weather in the second half. Discipline was the most important thing, especially in these rainy conditions.\n\"We wanted to make our country proud but we didn't. We should have pulled this win through but all credit to the All Blacks, they are a quality side.\"\nSouth Africa: Le Roux; Pietersen, Kriel, de Allende, Habana; Pollard, du Preez; Mtawarira, B. du Plessis, Malherbe; Etzebeth, de Jager; Louw, Burger, Vermeulen\nReplacements: Serfontein for de Allende (80), Lambie for Pollard (66), Nyakane for Mtawarira (53), Strauss for B. du Plessis (53), J. du Plessis for Malherbe (60), Matfield for de Jager (60), Alberts for Burger (64)\nNot Used: Pienaar\nSin Bin: Habana (52)\nNew Zealand: B.

Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far.\"\nShe has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career.\nHere are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years.\nSuper Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible.\nNot Michael Jackson.\nAfter shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety.\nIt was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing.\nBrilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi.\nBeat that, Gaga.\nBaby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera.\nIn his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: \"Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mike\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BOOM!\n\"And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up and\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BLAM! BORN TO RUN!\"\nIt led to the memorable headline: \"America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch\" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds.\nColdplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce.\nShe only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement.\nSome of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring \"Justice 4 Mario Woods\" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier.\nThe performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year.\nYou can't out-diva Diana, something she was determined to prove when she strode onto the pitch in Tempe, Arizona, for Super Bowl XXX.\nShe raced through 10 songs and four costume changes in 12 minutes, then jumped into a helicopter and fled the stadium. Which is one way to beat the post-game traffic.\nFor the first few decades, the Super Bowl half-time performance featured marching bands, drill teams and Disney's mouseketeers.\n1987's show was altogether more bizarre.\nA magician named \"Elvis Presto\" burst out of a jukebox, before performing a series of conjuring tricks, aided by 2,000 part-time dancers, 102 custom Harley Davidson motorcycles and some of rock's biggest classics.\nAt the culmination of the show, the \"Prince of Prestidigitation\" performed an interactive magic trick (\"pick a card, concentrate real hard\") while viewers at home watched through 3D glasses.\nIt was cheesier than a wheel of brie - and prompted the NFL to adopt a more modern approach.\nShe arrived on a mechanical tiger, and departed on a shooting star - but Katy Perry couldn't compete with the infamous \"left shark\".\nHe was one of two foam-suited dancers flanking Katy while she performed Teenage Dream. While the one on the right was forgettable, the left shark flailed around in a desperate attempt to remember his dance moves.\nIt quickly became a viral sensation, spawning a whole range of merchandise from the ever-savvy pop star.\nAnd when the half-time show was nominated for an Emmy, Katy made sure to thank her faithful friend.\nPoor old Janet Jackson. She was at the end of a triumphant, hit-laden medley when Justin Timberlake ripped the front off her bodice, revealing a heavily-bejewelled superboob.\nFew ever believed that the \"wardrobe malfunction\" was indeed a malfunction - but if you look at the photographs taken immediately after the event, Jackson appears mortified (notably, these were not the pictures printed by the press).\nNonetheless, America went apoplectic. The Federal Complaints Commission reportedly got more than 200,000 complaints, while Janet was blacklisted by MTV and radio. Her career never fully recovered.\nBut there is a bright side to this story. A PayPal employee called Jawed Karim missed the half-time show and grew frustrated that he couldn't watch the incident online.\nIn response, he and his friends Steve Chen and Chad Hurley began coding a website where people could upload their own content. That site would end up being YouTube.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

The ultimate danger from that is that they might be unable to make debt payments as they come due.\nCentral banks can address that by lending them extra money (liquidity). In the UK the Bank of England has already been doing this ahead of the referendum, hoping to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity already in place. The Bank has said it \"will continue to monitor market conditions carefully and keep its operations under review\".\nOther central banks will be ready to take similar action if they think it's needed.\nWhat if the strains show up in terms of foreign currency liquidity - say an Italian bank needing quick access to Swiss francs?\nThere are arrangements known as swap lines put in place during the international financial crisis that can be used if necessary. The Italian bank could then get Swiss francs from the European Central Bank (ECB), (and the Swiss National Bank would be able to offer euros to Swiss banks if needed). The Bank of England is involved in these arrangements so it can get foreign currency if British banks were to need it urgently.\nWith sharp moves in exchange rates, there are several options. They could just live with it. But if they felt the swings were too sharp and destabilising they could intervene using their foreign currency reserves.\nIn the case of the UK, the decision to conduct such intervention is for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, with the Bank of England carrying it out in the markets.\nSo if there were too precipitous a fall in the value of one currency (sterling would be the obvious candidate in the event of a leave vote) the Bank of England could buy sterling with dollars or yen from its reserves, hoping the additional demand for the pound would support its value.\nConversely the Swiss National Bank has been worried about too rapid a rise in the Swiss franc and has already been into the markets to buy other currencies such as the euro with its own national currency.\nFurther action on these lines is a possibility. Currencies seen as havens are susceptible to unwanted sharp rises in times of financial stress and the Swiss franc is a prime example of that.\nCurrency market intervention is often not announced. Some observers say there is evidence suggesting that the Swiss central bank might have intervened over the past week.  The intervention after the vote by the SNB was announced however.\nInterest rates can also be used to curb currency moves - a cut to stop a currency rising; a rate rise to prevent a fall.\nBoth options, interest rate moves and intervention, can be co-ordinated by central banks.\nFurther quantitative easing (QE) is also a possible response to a rising currency. It tends to drive down market interest rates and there has been some speculation that it might be on the agenda very soon,  perhaps from the Bank of Japan (which does not want to see the yen gaining value).\nInterest rate moves and QE can also be used to address longer term fallout - to tackle any impact on inflation or growth. The Bank of England has scope to cut rates further and it could undertake further QE. A fall in sterling would be inflationary, though up to a point that could be welcome as inflation is currently (at 0.3%) far below the Bank's target (2%).\nAnother risk is that in a general flight from riskier assets the government debt problem in the eurozone could return, pushing up borrowing costs for countries such as Spain and Italy that were in the firing line a few years ago.\nThose earlier eurozone storms abated after the ECB announced that it was prepared in some circumstances to buy the bonds, the debts, of governments severely affected. In the event it never used this new weapon. The mere threat of doing so was enough to settle the eurozone bond market.\nSome observers, such as the London consultancy Capital Economics, think it could finally use this programme, if the aftermath of a leave vote were sufficiently disruptive.\nThe likely timescale for these options varies.  In principle many could be done very quickly. The most urgent, if needed, would probably be bank liquidity. Interest rates and QE could be announced early, but could also be used as a response to economic fallout that might emerge over a longer period.\nThe ECB's option of riding to the rescue of the likes of Spain or Italy would take some time. They would need to have an economic policy programme agreed with the rest of the eurozone. And Spain in particular, with an election this weekend, is itself in a period of political uncertainty that could make it difficult to conduct international negotiations.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Economic policymakers must now decide whether and how they should respond to the UK's vote to leave the EU.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

After winning possession, Naismith ran into the area to receive a Baines pass before stabbing a shot at goal. Rodriguez tried to clear, but the ball cannoned off goalkeeper Diego Benaglio, and hit the Wolfsburg full-back again before ending up in his own net.\nThat was Everton's first goal in Europe at Goodison Park since beating Sporting Lisbon 2-1 in February 2010, and it had the buoyant home crowd hungry for more.\nEverton duly attempted to deliver, with full-backs Baines and Coleman becoming more adventurous as Wolfsburg offered little going forward, and their attacking instincts resulted in the home side's second goal on the stroke of half-time.\nMirallas's drive was weakly pushed into the path of Baines, who had followed the shot into the area, and he knocked the ball across goal for Coleman to nod in.\nWolfsburg boss Dieter Hecking introduced Germany midfielder Aaron Hunt for the start of the second half, but within seconds of the restart Everton went further ahead. This time, Robin Knoche's foul on McGeady was deemed to have occurred inside the area, and Baines confidently despatched the resulting penalty.\nThe goal effectively ended Wolfsburg's hopes of returning to Germany with anything to show but, with nothing to lose, they embarked on a spell of dominance.\nFor a good 30 minutes they enjoyed the lion's share of possession and attempts on goal, as Tim Howard produced saves from Luiz Gustavo's opportunistic shot and Rodriguez's well-struck free-kick.\nFormer Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner was introduced after the hour, with Wolfsburg boss Hecking sensing a possible goal, but instead it was Everton who grabbed a fourth. Mirallas peeled away from defenders to run on to substitute Samuel Eto'o's through ball and he coolly slotted in at Benaglio's near post.\nThere was still time for Wolfsburg to get the consolation their 27 shots on goal deserved, Rodriguez making some amends for his early own goal with a curling free-kick.\nEverton boss Roberto Martinez: \"The atmosphere was perfect for us to start a very good performance.\n\"I thought there were two very good sides. On the night the scoreline probably doesn't reflect the difference between the two sides.\n\"We scored at the right times. Our work-rate was magnificent. We had to defend and we did that really well but every time we went forward we had a clinical touch about us.\"\nWolfsburg boss Dieter Hecking: \"It's obviously not the start we'd hoped for. We were lacking in certain areas, both in terms of finishing and defensive work.\n\"We should have gone into half-time a goal down and we got hit with a second just before the break.

Not a bit of it. Perhaps it's because men are squeamish, or don't like to talk about their health or visit the doctor, but prostate cancer has long been dubbed \"the Cinderella cancer\".\n\"We just don't make enough of it\" according to consultant oncologist Professor Neil Burnet. \"On the whole men are less vocal about their health, and older men tend to be even more stoical, preferring to grin and bear it. But it means men are poor advocates, and as a result prostate cancer has been overlooked\".\nBased at Addenbrooke's Hospital on the outskirts of Cambridge, Prof Burnet is trying to improve the targeting and efficiency of radiotherapy treatments, and to reduce toxicity in the healthy tissue surrounding the prostate. The technique, called Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatment uses imaging provided by a CT scan to target the tumour before a powerful but precisely shaped radiation dose is administered.\n\"What limits what we can do with radiotherapy are the side effects of the treatment, the toxicity.  And, since the prostate can move by up to a couple of centimetres from one day to the next, targeting the treatment is really important. The second half of this technology is in delivering intensity modulated radiotherapy, which allows us to match a higher dose of radiation to the shape of the tumour.\"\nBut if Image Guided IMRT offers the prospect of better outcomes for men with advanced or aggressive prostate cancer, how much better might it be to get in at an earlier stage?\nThat - at least in part - was the motivation behind the Collaborative Oncological Gene/Environment Study, or COGES, which has announced the discovery of 80 new genetic markers for breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. In one of the largest research projects of its kind scientists from Cambridge University and the Institute of Cancer Research in London looked at samples from more than 200,000 people - half with, and half without, cancer.\nThe results include 23 new gene variants associated with prostate cancer and 16 with aggressive forms of the disease. Initially at least that should help with the development of a viable screening test for the disease. In the longer term it may present new targets for drug treatment and better diagnosis, and a greater understanding of the mechanisms and basic biology of prostate cancer.\n\"It's shocking, but we still don't have an adequate screening test for prostate cancer,\" says Ros Eeles, Professor of Oncogenetics at the Institute of Cancer Research and COGES study leader on prostate cancer. \"That's because the Prostate Specific Antigen, or PSA test, just isn't accurate enough and you'd have to treat between 12 and 48 men unnecessarily to save a single life. With this new information we could have a viable test in five to eight years\".\nIf that still seems a long way off, surgical techniques have advanced dramatically when it comes to prostate cancer. These days consultant urologist Professor David Neal uses the DaVinci surgical robot to perform prostate surgery.\nSitting at a computer console that looks like it would be more at home in an amusement arcade than an operating theatre, Prof Neal can perform a prostatectomy without ever touching his patient. And because the robotic arms of the device (which looks a little like a crab hovering over the operating table) are much thinner than the surgeon's, and the grappling and cutting tools at the sharp end are much smaller, what was once a major operation is now less invasive.\nAs with Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy collateral damage to surrounding healthy tissue is kept to a minimum.\n\"The DaVinci robot has made a huge difference to prostate surgery\" says Prof Neal. \"It's still a major operation, but we can be very precise about what we remove and the function we're able to save. That's got to be good news for the patient\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "It's a sobering thought for all us carriers of the Y chromosome, but prostate cancer kills almost as many men every year as breast cancer does women.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Taxiways and aprons - where aircraft park - have also been sabotaged.\nAbout 50,000 Iraqi security forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen, assisted by US-led coalition airstrikes, are currently involved in a military offensive to reclaim Mosul from IS militants.\nGovernment forces have already retaken dozens of villages and towns surrounding the city and are currently consolidating gains made in Mosul's eastern outskirts.\nThe damage to the runways has rendered the airport worthless as an asset for attacking forces, says Stratfor. Airports or runways are typically a primary objective for assaults on cities, since control over them can deny or enable logistical capabilities, having a considerable impact on the outcome of battles.\nHowever, IS militants have ensured there is little left for approaching forces to gain by taking the site, Stratfor says.\nIS employed a similar tactic at Qayyarah air base, 70km (43 miles) south of Mosul. However, the trenches dug there only partially covered the main runway, Stratfor says, and it was restored to service within months of the Iraqi forces recapturing the base in July.\nBy comparison, Mosul airport's destruction could be much more difficult to repair.\nMirroring the demolition at Qayyarah, IS fighters have also levelled almost every structure at Mosul airport.\nStratfor says that as well as preventing Iraqi forces and their allies from using the facilities, the tactic also serves to clear the line of sight for IS defensive positions on the northern edge of the airport.\nAlong with restoring the runways, Iraqi forces would need to rebuild hangars, warehouses and other infrastructure in order to use it as a logistical base.\nIn contrast to the widespread destruction elsewhere in the area, the images show how the city's sugar factory remains relatively intact - testimony to its utility to IS.\nAfter the jihadists captured Mosul in June 2014, they continued to operate the factory, says Stratfor, and more than a year later, executed the plant's manager when she refused to run it for them.\nHowever, the images also show how coalition airstrikes, aimed at destroying key IS positions and assets, have caused some damage to the buildings.\nSatellite imagery released last week, showed how IS had constructed multiple barricades across key routes into the northern Iraqi city.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Satellite images of Mosul have revealed how fighters from so-called Islamic State (IS) have destroyed much of the city's airport to render it unusable as Iraqi forces close in.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

When asked if it is \"tens of millions\" of dollars, he replies, \"I would not like to be too specific, but I wouldn't contradict what you just said.\"\nTrained as a neuroscientist, Mr Kuhn became an investment banker and then in the early 1990s sold his mergers and acquisitions firm \"at the right time\".\nHe says he worked hard, \"but if I don't acknowledge there was a lot of luck involved I would be fooling myself\".\nHe wants to encourage more and more people to become wealthy, but also to place limits on the amount of wealth that can be passed on to the next generation.\n\"That gives each generation a chance to have higher social mobility.\"\nBut given that the gap between rich and poor has reached its widest level for 30 years in most developed countries, according to says the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) group of developed nations - that social mobility is getting harder for many.\nIn the 1980s, the richest 10% had incomes seven times greater than the poorest 10% in the average industrialised country.\nNow, in those same countries, the richest have incomes nine-and-a half times greater than the poorest, on average. The actual figures vary widely across the 34 OECD's member states.\nIn Denmark the top 10% earn about five times more than the bottom 10% - in Mexico they earn 30 times as much.\nHow much more do the top 10% earn than the bottom 10%?\nSource: OECD (2011)\nOther organisations, too, are highlighting this discrepancy between rich and poor. A report this month from the charity Oxfam says the world's wealthiest 1% will own more than 50% of the world's wealth by 2016.\n\"This is something that we should be very worried about,\" says Mark Pearson, the OECD's deputy director of employment, labour and social affairs.\nIf countries want to boost their economic growth, then they need to take steps to narrow this wealth gap, says the OECD.\nThis goes against the longstanding free market argument that rising wealth at the top will trickle down to everybody else.\nBut, the OECD research suggest that the reverse is true. \"Our finding is that by reducing income inequality, you can boost economic growth,\" Mr Pearson told BBC World Service's Business Daily programme.\nAn increasing wealth gap hinders economic growth because it limits investment in a country's labour force, argues the OECD.\nPoorer people cannot afford to spend as much as the rich can on their children's education.\nAnd that lack of investment in education means a less educated and less flexible workforce in the long run, says the group in its research.\nIt is not just the super-rich that are doing well - those whose business is dealing with super-rich customers are profiting too.\nAlex Cheatle is chief executive of Ten Group, a lifestyle concierge service that can helps its clients get that exclusive restaurant table, sell-out theatre ticket - or finds that vintage sports car in a particular colour.\nTen will even do your window-shopping for you, if you are too rich or famous to be able to do it yourself.\n\"Very often they will want us to take a picture of the window and get it to them, so they do their window shopping as and when they want to,\" says Mr Cheatle.\n\"There hasn't really been a crisis for many of our members. Business is booming for us, we've grown every year since 2008 - growing at an average rate of 25-30% a year.\"\nWhen you consider how much the super-rich spend, that growth is perhaps not surprising.\nOver the course of a year, it's reckoned the world's top 1% spend a staggering $45bn (\u00a330bn) on travel and hospitality, $40bn (\u00a326bn) on cars, and $25bn (\u00a316bn) each on art, jewellery and watches.\nOr course, the ultimate statement of wealth is to have your own super-yacht - complete with helicopter pad, speedboat tenders and even a submarine or two.\nThe world's biggest such boat is currently the Azzam, 180m (590ft) long, launched in 2013 at a reported cost of up to $600m (\u00a3400m) - and the sector has certainly weathered the global slowdown better than many others.\nSource: Boat International\nSo with the wealth gap rising should the rich pay more tax, and if so would that help?\nRobert Kuhn - now business and financial commentator - argues that countries that decide to increase taxes on the rich may not see any benefit.\nHe believes increasing income taxes to too high a level would \"inhibit the creation of new wealth which is detrimental to society\".\n\"I'm just worried about the behaviour and implications if you put too high a tax rate, what that will do to current generations in their energy and focus to create new wealth,\" says Mr Kuhn.\nAt Scipio Partnership, Catherine Tillotson says that focussing on tax misses out the contributions made by many rich patrons to philanthropic and charitable causes.\n\"The tax question is hugely complicated,\" she says.\n\"Most families that I've met will say that it is absolutely critical to them that they pay the right amount of tax according to the rules.\"\nHowever, \"in many ways those dollars spent on philanthropic passions may be doing more good than they would have done in the tax system\", she says.\nYet ever since the financial crisis of 2008, and subsequent global economic slowdown, politicians have come under increasing pressure to increase tax contributions from the richest in their societies.\nProtest movements such as Occupy Wall Street, which started in 2011 and has since spread to many other countries, have highlighted concern over social and economic inequality worldwide.\nFor his part, Robert Kuhn is not convinced that a widening wealth gap matters in economic terms, but \"it matters in social stability for sure\", he agrees.\n\"It matters in terms of social mobility of subsequent generations.\"\n\"To me that's the biggest problem, for any country,\" he says. \"And many countries are facing that.\"\nClick here for more from BBC's A Richer World, a season exploring the world's wealth, poverty and inequality\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "These days it is not enough just to be a millionaire to count yourself as one of the super-rich - you need to be worth between $50-100m (\u00a333m-\u00a366m).", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The morning after the Englishman's stunning upset of Klitschko and his acquisition of the WBA, IBF and WBO belts, he admitted he might struggle to cope.\nBut not even those closest to him could have anticipated how true that would prove. Having beaten the various boxing authorities to the punch and relinquished the belts before being banned, stripped or both, it's anyone's guess as to when - if ever - he'll have his keys back and his engine revving again.\nFury has been speaking about his mental health struggles for years, with disarming and often alarming frankness. So his pronouncement immediately after his victory over Klitschko and the recent news that he was withdrawing from the scheduled rematch because of depression was not a shock.\nWhen I interviewed him in 2013, he described himself as \"an all-action man in anything I do. If I'm drinking, I'm drinking until I can't stand up. If I'm going out for Chinese, I'm going to an all-you-can-eat Chinese. If I'm eating cake, I'm eating the whole cake. I don't know what you'd call me. An idiot, maybe?\"\nHardly surprising, then, that having fulfilled his dream of winning the world heavyweight crown, Fury would lose focus. Most people having fallen down drunk or eaten a whole cake would steer clear of booze and Battenbergs for a while. But Fury is not most people.\nFury is not the first boxer to lose motivation having reached the pinnacle of the sport, and he certainly won't be the last. Not many people climb Everest twice.\nThe repeated claims from Fury's camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional\nAfter pulling off one of the greatest shocks in sporting history by beating the seemingly invincible Mike Tyson in 1990, Buster Douglas didn't train much, got fat and lost the world heavyweight crown to Evander Holyfield in his first defence. The American promptly retired, almost doubled in weight, then nearly died after falling into a diabetic coma before being struck down by depression. Same old, same old.\nJess Willard's victory over the great Jack Johnson in 1915 was almost as unbelievable as Douglas's upset of Tyson, and his reign even more shameful. Willard clearly didn't fancy fighting much, defending the world heavyweight crown once in four years before being bashed up by the great Jack Dempsey.\nSometimes depression can be triggered by a lack of motivation for the thing that defines you, sometimes that lack of motivation is triggered by depression. Either way, Fury claims he hasn't been near a gym for months and has been drinking like a fish and hoovering up cocaine instead, in a forlorn bid to mask the pain.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone magazine this month, Fury accused the British media of conducting a \"witch hunt\" against him and the British public of racism. It is important to separate the different links in Fury's sometimes rambling trains of thought.\nBefore and after his victory over Klitschko, sports writers openly discussed whether Fury should be saved from himself. Different journalists operate under different editorial guidelines, but the view of most was that they had been sent to Germany to report on a fight, not Fury's controversial outbursts.\nAs such, the repeated claims from Fury's camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional. Almost every boxing writer proclaimed Fury's performance as one of the finest ever by a British fighter, and they were right.\nBut the problem with a siege mentality is that you forget what's happening beyond the castle walls, who your real friends are, and paranoia sets in.\nWhen Fury threatened violence against a journalist and later took aim at bisexual, transsexual and Jewish people, it was internet vloggers - to whom he had granted intimate access - who provided the platform. The so-called mainstream media (newspapers and major broadcasters) had been frozen out, ironically because they had dared to report what he had told those same vloggers.\nFury's camp would do well to memorise a quote attributed to George Orwell: \"Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printing. Everything else is public relations.\" How many times has Fury been saved by journalistic self-censorship?\nIn threatening that journalist, the Mail on Sunday's Oliver Holt, for reporting that he had compared homosexuality to paedophilia, Fury betrayed his sense of entitlement - not only because of his feats in the ring, but because of his religious convictions. If it's in the Bible, how dare anyone question his beliefs?\nIf you make questionable statements about gay people or Jews or women, the media will come down on you, whether you are a fine boxer, a deeply religious man, a nice bloke really, none of the above or all of them. Fury's Traveller heritage doesn't come into it, as least as far as most of the media is concerned.\n\"I know Tyson personally and he's a really nice guy,\" says Ricky Hatton, Fury's fellow Mancunian and another boxer who has struggled with depression. \"But sometimes he puts his mouth into gear before his brain and when someone puts a camera in front of him he feels he has to say something outrageous.\"\nFury fans frequently claim that Anthony Joshua is given preferential treatment by the media, but this is because the IBF heavyweight champion - Fury was stripped of that belt shortly after winning it because he would not face the federation's mandatory challenger - largely conducts himself like a gentleman. As for Joshua's brushes with the law, they have been covered at length in the media and he has clearly learnt from them.\nHowever, some of the racial abuse Fury receives on social media is despicable.\nWhen you are called every name under the sun on a daily basis, it is likely to have an effect on your mental wellbeing. No wonder, as Fury also stated in his interview with Rolling Stone, that he feels like everyone is out to get him.\nOn Wednesday, the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) met to discuss what should be done with Fury, and has suspended his licence, pending a meeting with him. It could hardly do otherwise. It did the same to Hatton in 2010, also following allegations of cocaine use, and, as the BBBofC's general secretary Robert Smith has pointed out, \"cocaine is against the law of the land\".\nThere was also Fury's alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs and a subsequent ban to consider (Fury has an appeal hearing scheduled in November), as well as the allegation that he refused to take a drugs test (a misdemeanour that can lead to a four-year ban) and the argument that a man with severe mental health issues shouldn't be anywhere near a boxing ring.\nIt should also be remembered that the BBBofC has already fined Fury twice for misconduct and that it has boxing's image to think about - as mad as that sounds.\nEven if Fury hadn't voluntarily given up his belts, the WBA and WBO would have stripped him of them.\nIt might seem callous, but the sanctioning bodies are businesses, the heavyweight belts are their biggest money-spinners and it is only fair that other boxers should be allowed to fight for them. It makes no difference whether a boxer has meningitis, a broken leg or mental health issues, the sport must move on. As WBO chief Jose Izquierdo put it: \"We can't have a belt held hostage.\"\nOne can only hope that, during his absence from the ring, Fury gets the help he so desperately needs and returns fitter and more focused.\n\"Being someone who lives by the seat of his pants and for the moment, this could be the end of him,\" was Hatton's grim assessment. \"He doesn't like boxing and finds the training hard. It's not looking good.\n\"But I was in a dark place, didn't care if I lived or died. I did very well in boxing but near enough everything wrong in life. The only way I got out of it was by asking for help. I fought through it and I hope Tyson can do the same.\"\nFingers crossed that Fury will be remembered for that fine performance against Klitschko in Dusseldorf - and for many fine performances in the future - rather than as a wreck, spewing smoke on the side of the road as bright lights flash by.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "For a man often described as capricious, Tyson Fury's chaotic reign as world heavyweight champion was strangely predictable.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

With their team absent from major tournaments for 58 years, generations in Wales have grown up to expect failure and look on longingly as others contest World Cups and European Championships.\nBut Chris Coleman's men have changed that. The beaming smiles on Welsh fans' faces before their opening match in Bordeaux spoke of a disbelief at seeing their team finally claiming their place among international football's elite.\n\"There was a psychological barrier we needed to go through for the first one, given it had been so long,\" said Coleman.\n\"We've now sampled tournament football - such an experience, such a healthy vibe from people of all nations. We want some more of that. We need some more of that.\"\nWales' players would have been forgiven for feeling as if they were living in a bubble at their training base in the idyllic Brittany coastal town of Dinard, where a small population and a gentle pace of life meant they could take a stroll on the beach and go unnoticed.\nIt is a far cry from the frenzy their success has caused back home.\nWith every victory in France, a new fan zone seemed to spring up in Wales, from Rhyl to Aberystwyth, from Swansea to Cardiff's Principality Stadium.\nHe saw us grow up. He's always in the back of our minds. When we achieve something, we think about him\nThe messages of support were many and varied, from David Hasselhoff to the Prince of Wales, while songs by Welsh bands the Manic Street Preachers and the Super Furry Animals gave the campaign a unique soundtrack.\nDespite their serene and remote surroundings, however, the players were aware of the impression they were making.\nIn the age of social media, athletes and their followers are closer than ever, and Wales' squad members have relished that connection.\nHal Robson-Kanu's spectacular goal against Belgium made the unattached forward one of the unlikeliest stars of Euro 2016 and, speaking a couple of days later, he laughed when told about the global reaction to his goal - including a tweet from the former Nigeria and Arsenal striker Kanu.\nThere was a similar response from Joe Allen, who laughed when this reporter informed him of a fans' banner that read: \"When God made Joe Allen, he was showing off.\"\nFrom a journalist's perspective, covering this Wales side has been a privilege, given regular and revealing access to the coaches and players.\nGareth Bale, the world's most expensive footballer, was a picture of charm and affability as he conducted his media conferences and subsequent interviews before every match. The Real Madrid forward was as comfortable talking about the Wales squad's quiz nights and their occasional treats of burgers and chips as he was about the actual football.\nFor all the lustre the likes of Bale and Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey add to this Wales side, it is the unbreakable team spirit that has been the foundation of their success.\nThe vast majority of the squad have played youth football together, grown up together and become close friends.\nEven when Bale is injured, he will join up with the squad in order to see those he misses while on club duty in Spain - Joe Ledley and Wayne Hennessey are among those he gets on with best.\nThese genuine friendships have bound the team together, as has a tragedy that cast a shadow over football.\nThe death of Coleman's predecessor Gary Speed in 2011 shocked the entire sport, with the grief particularly profound for his young Wales players, many of whom are in the current side.\nCaptain Ashley Williams was clearly moved as he spoke about Speed on the eve of the match against Portugal.\n\"My thought coming in was I hope he'd be proud of us. He saw us grow up, and what we've achieved today,\" he said. \"He's always in the back of our minds. When we achieve something, we think about him.\"\nSpeed was on the supporters' minds as well, with cries of \"There's only one Speedo\" heard at every game.\nA friend of Speed's since childhood, Coleman says he thinks about his former team-mate every day, whether there is a fixture or not.\nSucceeding his friend as Wales manager was a wrench for Coleman but there can be no doubt he and his players have done Speed proud.\nColeman said before the match against Portugal that this run to the semi-finals would not represent the end of his team's journey.\nAbsent from major tournaments for 58 years before Euro 2016, Wales are unwilling to endure another long wait.\nThe current crop of players is ripe for an era of regular qualifying, with Ashley Williams and James Collins the only players over 30 to start the match against Portugal. An average age of just over 27 means Wales' squad was the seventh youngest of the 24 teams at Euro 2016, and Coleman believes this tournament could be a springboard for further success.\n\"The one thing that will stop us from doing it again is ourselves,\" he said.\n\"We're good enough. We have to have the same hunger and desire, and we'll give the World Cup campaign a hell of a crack.\"\nWales will be back in action in September when they host Moldova in their opening qualifier for the 2018 World Cup.\nPlanning for that campaign can wait for now, though. With a homecoming parade taking place in Cardiff on Friday, Wales will take this opportunity to reflect on and revel in the magnitude of their achievement.\nJust as they were at the final whistle in Lyon, Wales' players will be greeted by the great 'Red Wall' in Cardiff.\nReturning home will feel like the end of the journey but, where Coleman and his players are concerned, this is not the final act.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Standing hand-in-hand like theatre actors at their curtain call, Wales' players were met with a spine-tingling rendition of the national anthem from their fans following their European Championship semi-final defeat by Portugal.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Yes, the Westminster government's continuing agenda of cuts plays a part, but we cannot let that stop us.\n\"We can push further on a real Living Wage across our economy, and we can boost people's health by committing to a major programme of housebuilding and energy efficiency measures, along with better public transport and cycling and walking infrastructure.\"\nAnalysis by Reevel Alderson, BBC Scotland Home affairs correspondent\nThe Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) is published every four years.\nIt provides the government and local authorities with a considerable amount of information aimed at helping them tackle the problem.\nThe index breaks Scotland down into 6,976 \"datazones\", effectively small postcode areas, and ranks levels of deprivation there on seven criteria.\nThese are: income, employment, health, education, housing, access to services and crime.\nOverall scores are then provided for each datazone.\nBut that is not the full picture.\nThe statisticians say \"deprived\" does not just mean \"poor\" or \"low income\".\nIt can also mean people have fewer resources and opportunities, for example in health and education.\nOne area may score well on educational outcomes for example, but have poor health and access to services.\nThe Scottish government says this \"allows effective analysis for targeting of policies and funding where the aim is to wholly or partly tackle or take account of area concentrations of multiple deprivation.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Ferguslie Park in Paisley has been identified as the area of Scotland with the greatest level of deprivation.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

It has shades of the convenient \"lone wolf\" theory about it. Was he the only player to get this stuff? Did he talk to other players about it?\nCoaches involved in age-group rugby tell me that weight training and supplements appear to be going hand in hand\nHere is my thinking: I buy the argument that players are under pressure to get big. I buy the argument that players are under pressure to get heavier too. The rugby pitch has stayed the same size for 150 years while humans have changed. Rugby is more about going through people than round them now.\nWhat I don't buy is that players are under pressure to buy steroids. It's cheating. The moment you buy the things you are cheating. You know it's not allowed. You are hoping the drug testers never get to you.\nSome players may have contemplated taking steroids but chosen not to do so. If you're not big enough then choose another profession. It's not a game for all shapes and sizes any more.\nCoaches involved in age-group rugby tell me that weight training and supplements appear to be going hand in hand. Young players go to the gym after taking supplements, they drink supplements during their training, and immediately afterwards.\nPerhaps they are being indoctrinated into thinking that there is no way to do this consuming food alone. Maybe, just maybe, the logical next step from that is that artificial aids help, and the last resort - and illegal - artificial aid is your steroid of choice.\nSo is it possible to get big enough taking food alone?\nThe IRB has its latest drug test figures on its website. It states: \"The IRB carried out 1,542 tests both in and out of competition in 2012, across all IRB tournaments and events, including the HSBC Sevens World Series, Rugby World Cup 2015 qualifiers, men's and women's Tests and Age Grade Rugby.\n\"The programme saw a total of 21 anti-doping rule violation cases, equating to 1.36% of the IRB's entire programme.\"\nThat means around 1.4% of elite level players take drugs and try to get away with it. Some of them, you can see from the website, were caught taking the steroid favoured by both Sam Chalmers and disgraced Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, stanozolol.\nThe 2011 Word Anti-Doping Agency figures, also available on the IRB website, show there were 5,553 drug tests globally in rugby in 2011, and 61 violations within them - just over 1%.\nMy guess is that there are more chancing it lower down the leagues, or in that scramble to get into the system - but I don't know.\nWhen I was in South Africa covering the 1995 Rugby World Cup I wrote then what I repeat now - that the biggest growth in requests at GPs in Capetown nearly 20 years ago was from schoolboys wanting prescriptions for steroids. They were often accompanied by parents.\nCould this happen here?\nSam Chalmers was in the most susceptible group, which is young lads who want to get into professional, or at least top-level, rugby.\nIt's going to be tough on him. But life's not easy. It wasn't easy for the players and coaches in the \"Bloodgate\" affair, or in the various eye-gouging allegations, nor for the other 60-odd rugby players caught by the IRB taking drugs or tampering with their samples.\nThis is a test. He does his time and then he gets back in the game.\nI will leave you with this thought: I bet you he wasn't alone in this. And I bet there are younger players than Sam Chalmers who haven't been caught.\nWhat do you think? Are there pressures on players to take steroids?\nYou can follow John Beattie on Twitter @bbcjohnbeattie\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Scottish rugby suffered two body blows this week and, rather like boxer Ricky Burns who \"drew\" with his opponent after getting one heck of a hiding from opponent Raymundo Beltran, it's a little battered, a little broken and in need of time off the canvas.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

What he has definitely done is make people talk about Salford again.\nFar from being a prickly atmosphere in the studio, there appeared to be real warmth between the extrovert racehorse owner, the man he wants to coach his club - Brian Noble, and the rugby league legend he wants to sign from Warrington - Adrian Morley.\n\"The more Marwan's the merrier, the better,\" said Noble, the former Great Britain and Bradford Bulls coach still waiting for the right opportunity to return to the sport. \"You just need passionate people with some substance behind them to push the game forward. His passion fills you with enthusiasm, you want to get going and get cracking.\"\nThose comments will have been music to the ears of the fiercely ambitious Koukash, who learned the art of hard work during three years in a refugee camp in Jordan.\nHe admits he would be honoured for Noble to coach the team he is attempting to assemble at Salford. Another Brian - the Australian Brian Smith - is the other frontrunner.\nI understand Noble is keen to work with Koukash, but only if he is convinced the dream of this businessman, tempted into the sport by the RFL's chief executive Nigel Wood, can become a reality.\nA similar discussion about ambition and available funds saw Noble drop out of the running for the Castleford Tigers job before the appointment of Ian Millward, so Salford fans should not expect this to be a done deal.\nKey to the 'Good Doctor's' dream - he was labelled the 'Mad Doctor' during his outlandish early claims of racehorse success - is his campaign to raise the sport's \u00a31.8m salary cap. Koukash has, for the past few weeks, been lobbying to lift the limit that a club can spend on players to something nearer \u00a32.5m.\nHis argument is that this will not only make the rugby league a more attractive proposition for the best players in Australia and halt a talent drain to rugby union, but even reverse the process and tempt union players to league.\nNoble agrees that the cap may need a rethink - it was introduced to stop clubs overspending. But the only man to coach a club to three Super League Grand Final victories believes we might now need a carrot to bring in the bigger names to raise the sport's profile.\nHow much of a financial risk would this be?\nThis is a time the sport cannot even attract a title sponsor for Super League - a situation branded unacceptable by the St Helens chairman Eamonn McManus, who cites his own club's deal with tea-makers Typhoo as proof that the sport can pull in the blue-chip brands.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nKoukash clearly has cash and he wants to be able to spend it. But not every club is in a position to chase success in this way.\nMorley suggests there should be a loophole introduced to have two or three \"star name\" players paid as much as you like outside of the salary cap.\nKoukash added: \"There should be a mechanism in the sport to allow certain scenarios, clubs or situations to go and spend above the cap.\"\nThe man who made his millions from racehorses clearly feels he will be unable to attract rugby league's thoroughbreds to Salford under the current guidelines.\nSuch an argument is unlikely to be met with a huge nod of approval from the likes of Leeds chief executive Gary Hetherington who has built his own successful business model on a strict sliding salary scale at the Super League champions.\nThe bigger question of course is that of the sport's profile in World Cup year. McManus says this is rugby league's \"biggest single financial weakness\".\nThis is not a question about allowing Salford to sign as many players as they want. It is about maximising the exposure of the sport to the world and reaping the financial rewards of that.\nMcManus says the game's governing body needs to take responsibility. \"No sponsor is not acceptable. Either from the club's perspective or from that of the governing body,\" he said.\n\"Someone has to be answerable for that. It is something none of us are happy with and someone needs to be accountable.\"\nMcManus feels that if these weaknesses in the way the game is marketed are \"readily identified and dealt with\" then the game has never been in a stronger position to prosper and grow. Koukash will expect to be at the forefront of that.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Picture the scene inside the BBC 5 live studio: a millionaire owner of a now managerless Super League club, a highly rated out-of-work coach keen for a return to the sport and an iconic player from a rival club that the owner wants to sign.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

He moved to the Rocket Division of the Ministry of Supply in 1943.\nAfter the war he secured a job with the Daily Express as defence, science and medical editor.\nOne of his best contacts, the chief scientist at the Ministry of Defence in the 1950s, was keen to tell him as much as possible about Britain's atomic weapons programme.\nHe wanted to explain to the public why the country was spending such massive sums of money on it.\n\"I'm up for use any time,\" he said. \"If someone wants to come and tell me some news that nobody else knows and I make a lovely scoop of it, come on, use me!\"\nBut it never worried him that he was being used by senior figures with ideas to promote or scores to settle.\nHis investigative methods were unorthodox. Mainly he bought people agreeable lunches and, over the claret, senior civil servants and politicians would tell him things.\nHis favourite lunch venue was a classy French restaurant called L'Ecu de France in Jermyn Street off Piccadilly, handy both for Fleet Street and for the civil servants and politicians in Westminster.\nOnly after it closed did he learn that the place had been bugged by MI5 since the 1940s. (It had also, MI5 discovered when removing its own hidden microphones, been bugged by the KGB.)\n\"MI5 heard every conversation that I had and they did nothing about it,\" he said.\n\"All they did was put it in the files. MI5 doesn't like to take any action; they like to know.\n\"'It's in the files: if we take action, they'll know we know.' That's the attitude. It's absolutely crazy.\"\nPincher cultivated contacts not only at the lunch table but in the countryside.\nIn the 1950s he took up game shooting, and met a good many useful sources while banging away in plus-fours at pheasant and grouse.\nLord Mountbatten, aloof and unapproachable as first sea lord and chief of the defence staff, turned out to be much friendlier when Pincher encountered him shooting.\n\"He invited me to shoot at Broadlands and even dictated a story to me once when I was travelling in his Land Rover, which went straight into the newspaper... but under my name, not his.\"\nIn 1964 he brought into the open the scandal over Ferranti's \u00c2\u00a35 million profit on Bloodhound missiles, which were the major weapon in Britain's air defences.\nThis was a colossal sum at the time and a subsequent inquiry saw the company refunding more than \u00c2\u00a34 million to the Treasury.\nIn 1971, Pincher revealed how the number of staff at the Soviet embassy had increased significantly and claimed that most of the diplomats, chauffeurs and gardeners were really spies.\nThis prompted Edward Heath's government to expel 105 of them, which seriously damaged the Soviet Union's espionage capability.\nAfter his retirement, Pincher's most controversial book was Their Trade is Treachery. This revealed the head of MI5 until 1965, Sir Roger Hollis, had been investigated as a suspected Soviet spy.\nThere was an immense furore, which Pincher doubtless found most gratifying.\nIn the years since, Pincher hardened his line on Hollis, and continued researching the subject becoming convinced that Hollis actually was a Soviet mole.\nNot everyone agrees. Christopher Andrew, MI5's official historian, thinks it's nonsense to suggest Hollis was a traitor.\nRupert Allason, who writes about espionage under the pen name Nigel West, is more nuanced. \"Some people don't believe there was any hostile penetration of the security service.\n\"Personally I've seen the evidence: I know there was penetration up until at least September 1963.\n\"Where I part company with Harry is on the issue of candidates. He believes it was Sir Roger Hollis, I'm not convinced of that; but I am persuaded there was a mole.\"\nOne of the main sources for Pincher's book was the former MI5 agent Peter Wright, whose book Spycatcher was the subject of a long court case to try to prevent publication.\nMargaret Thatcher's government was infuriated by Their Trade is Treachery; but then angering prime ministers was nothing new to Pincher.\nIn May 1959, Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan wrote a personal minute, marked \"secret\", to his minister of defence.\n\"I do not understand,\" he wrote, \"how the Express alone of all the newspapers has got the exact decision that we reached at the cabinet last Thursday on space. Can nothing be done to suppress or get rid of Mr Chapman Pincher?\n\"I am getting very concerned about how well informed he always seems to be on defence matters.\"\nAnd the Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson contributed to what may have been Pincher's finest moment in 1967.\nWhat became known as \"the D notice affair\" began with a \"walk-in\", a member of the public who turns up at a newspaper's front door with a possible scoop.\nThe information given to Pincher was that all private cables and Post Office telegrams were being intercepted and that some were being read by GCHQ.\nBefore publishing the story, Pincher checked with a contact called Lt Col Sammy Lohan, secretary of the D notice committee.\nThe D notice system is a voluntary one, designed to alert the news media to stories that might damage national security if published.\nLohan told Pincher his story was not covered by any D notices, and the Express went ahead and printed the scoop.\nWilson was furious and set up an inquiry to show that D notices had in fact been breached. The inquiry concluded the exact opposite, and vindicated the Express.\nIn his Who's Who entry, Pincher listed ferreting in Whitehall and bolting politicians as two of his recreations.\nHe said he didn't regret a single thing he had found out and printed.\n\"I always tried to meet all the top people because that's where the stories lay,\" he said.\n\"When you have access to people you have access to facts, usually secret facts.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Chapman Pincher was known as \"the lone wolf of Fleet Street\".", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Spain are hoping to retain the title they won in 2008 and 2012.\nEngland will be appearing at their ninth finals, while Wales and Northern Ireland have qualified for the first time.\nGood question - because, for the first time, there are 24 teams competing in the finals. That is an increase from the 16 that had taken part in every edition since it was hosted in England in 1996.\nWith six groups of four teams, it means the top two will qualify for the last 16, plus the four best third-placed finishers. In other words, only eight teams will fail to qualify from the group stage.\nOne point could be enough to put your team into the last 16 - and from then the tournament goes to a knockout format.\nAs Greece proved by pulling off a sensational triumph at Euro 2004, trying to predict a winner is a difficult game.\nWorld champions Germany are understandably one of the favourites, while holders Spain are also short odds with the bookmakers.\nGermany finished top of their qualification group but booking their place in France was not without its hiccups - with defeats by Poland and the Republic of Ireland. They have been beaten by France and England since qualifying but remain one to watch.\nSpain dominated international football between 2008 and 2012 but failed to qualify from their group at the 2014 World Cup. Could this be a last hurrah for Vicente del Bosque's ageing but brilliant side?\nFrance won the World Cup as hosts in 1998 - can they repeat the famous success of the team led by Didier Deschamps, Zinedine Zidane and Laurent Blanc?\nA run into the latter stages by Les Bleus is likely to help restore national morale in a country still recovering from last year's deadly Paris attacks.\nFrance are the bookmakers' favourites to win the whole thing, but their form is tricky to gauge because they did not have to qualify for this tournament.\nFast on the counter and unified after years of internal division, watch out for talented midfielders Paul Pogba and Blaise Matuidi.\nBut they cannot call upon prolific Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema. The French Football Federation (FFF) said he would not be picked after being investigated for his part in an alleged plot to blackmail Les Bleus team-mate Mathieu Valbuena, who did not make the squad.\nWell, there are three of them in France - only Scotland missed out - plus the Republic of Ireland. It is going to get crowded too, because England and Wales are both in Group B, along with Russia and debutants Slovakia.\nDon't expect much work to get done when England and Wales play each other - that match in Lens will be shown live on BBC One, kick-off 14:00 BST, on Thursday, 16 June.\nRoy Hodgson's England have a good young team but doubts persist about their defence. They breezed through their qualifying group with a perfect record of 10 wins, while confidence was further boosted with March's impressive win away at world champions Germany.\nWales have got Real Madrid star Gareth Bale and plenty of heart. Chris Coleman's side reached their first major tournament in 57 years after losing just once in qualification.\nNorthern Ireland might have numerous players from England's lower leagues but they finished top of their qualifying group, losing just one of their 10 matches.\nStriker Kyle Lafferty could not get a game for club side Norwich during qualifying (he has since been loaned to Birmingham) but he scored seven crucial goals in nine games for his country.\nWith the 24-team format offering hope to traditionally less-successful nations, five countries have taken advantage to secure their European Championship finals debut.\nNorthern Ireland and Wales, of course, are two of them.\nSlovakia, who have been drawn alongside England and Wales in Group B, have qualified for the first time as an independent state. A 1-0 win against Spain showed the 2010 World Cup qualifiers can mix it with Europe's elite. Beware England and Wales.\nAlbania have never been near a major finals, but edged out Denmark - the 1992 champions - in their qualifying group thanks to a shock win in Portugal. Oh, and because they were awarded a 3-0 win in Serbia by the Court of Arbitration for Sport after a riot.\nWith a population of roughly 330,000 (comparable to Coventry) and only 21,508 registered players, Iceland are unsurprisingly the smallest nation to ever qualify for the finals.\nHow did they do that? By beating the Netherlands - 1988 winners and three-time semi-finalists - home and away during qualifying. The Dutch, for the first time since 1984, will not be there.\nReal Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who was voted the world's second best player behind Argentina's Lionel Messi in the 2015 Ballon d'Or vote, heads a star-studded cast.\nRonaldo will be leading Portugal's challenge, while Wales hope his club-mate Gareth Bale - the world's most expensive player - can transform his impressive La Liga form onto the international stage.\nWorld Cup winners Germany boast a host of stellar names who have impressed in previous tournaments, most notably Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and forward Thomas Muller plus Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos.\nFrance's challenge is set to be driven by energetic Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba, who is still reportedly courting the attention of several English Premier League sides.\nBelgium are not short of star quality either. Premier League pair Eden Hazard and Kevin de Bruyne will spearhead their quest for a first major tournament win, but the Red Devils are without injured captain Vincent Kompany.\nAnd Sweden superstar Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 34, will be hoping to illuminate an international tournament for what could be the final time.\nThe Netherlands' failure to qualify leaves Bayern Munich winger Arjen Robben watching from home, while his club-mate Franck Ribery was not named in the France squad, despite suggestions he was considering ending his international retirement.\nThe tournament's 51 games will be staged at 10 locations across France, including new stadiums in Bordeaux, Lille, Lyon and Nice.\nThe opening match - between France and Romania on 10 June - and the 10 July final will be played at the Stade de France in Paris.\nBuilding the new venues and renovating historic grounds such as Marseille's Stade Velodrome has cost 1.6bn euros (\u00a31.2bn) - modernisation which was necessary, organisers say, because France did not fully capitalise on hosting the 1998 World Cup.\nVibrating stands, floating roofs and adjacent slag heaps - read BBC Sport's venue-by-venue guide\nIn March this year, the International Football Association Board (IFAB) ratified a host of revisions to the laws of the game in an attempt to remove inconsistencies and meet the needs of the modern game. The changes came into effect on 1 June, so will apply for Euro 2016.\nMore than 90 revisions were made, but these are some of the key changes:\nKick-off: Previously, the ball had to go forward from kick-off but the rule has been changed to allow it to go in any direction.\nPre-match red cards: Players can now be sent off before a match gets under way, although they can be replaced by another player in the match-day squad.\nLeaving the pitch after treatment: If a player is injured in a challenge resulting in a yellow or red card, they no longer have to leave the field and can have a quick assessment or medical treatment. This change is designed to prevent situations where a team would be temporarily down to 10 players.\nThe end of 'triple punishment': A professional foul inside the area will now normally result in a yellow card for the offender, and not a red. This is to end the so-called triple punishment of penalty, dismissal and suspension, which was seen by some as excessive. There are exceptions for when the offender will receive a red which include holding, pushing or pulling and violent conduct.\nGoalline technology, already established in the Premier League and elsewhere, will be used at Euro 2016.\nYes. But you had better be quick. Most of the group games - including all of England's matches - are sold out.\nHowever, as of 9 June there are tickets available to watch Wales and Northern Ireland, plus other games involving some of the smaller nations. There are also tickets available for the opening game between France and Romania - at 395 euros each.\nFind the latest ticket details on Uefa's official Euro 2016 website\nEach of the 10 host cities will have official Uefa fan zones.

At such a time, one has to look at the strategy, at refinements that need to be made, at efforts that need to be augmented, and I know that's what's going on right now.\"\n1974: Graduates from West Point US military academy, joining the army\n2007: Leads US troop surge during Iraq conflict\n2008: Head of US Central Command\n2010: Nato commander in Afghanistan\nMid-2011: Leaves military to become CIA director\nNovember 2012: Resigns over affair\nAfter commanding international troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, Gen Petraeus became head of the CIA but was forced to stand down in 2012, following revelations of an extra-marital affair.\nSubsequent allegations that he provided classified information to his mistress while he was CIA director led him to plead guilty to one misdemeanour charge.\nBut despite the turbulence of his private life, Gen Petraeus remains one of the heroes of America's controversial military operations of recent years.\nHe was the architect of the \"surge\" in Iraq that deployed more US troops, but equally important, got them out of their defended compounds to create security at a local level.\nHe also greatly expanded the Anbar Awakening, the mobilisation of Sunni tribesmen to combat al-Qaeda.\nNot surprisingly in the wake of the recent setbacks in Iraq, his views are being canvassed by the White House, the Pentagon, and on Capitol Hill.\nThe keynote of the Petraeus approach today is as it always was - the need for the political and military aspects of strategy to march closely in step.\n\"You cannot deal with an industrial-strength extremist problem just with force of arms,\" he said.  \"You have to have that political component as well.\"\nPolitical change has to start at the top. Above all, Gen Petraeus says, \"the Sunni Arabs have to be given incentives to support the new Iraq rather than to oppose it\".\nAs to the fundamental question - can the Iraqi military actually win against Islamic State? - he has few doubts.\n\"During the surge and in the years after the surge, Iraqi forces fought and died for their country at vastly higher numbers than did US and coalition forces. We know that they can fight,\" he insists.\n\"We know that they will fight. But they will only fight if they have good leadership, and the support and knowledge that somebody will have their back if they get into a tough fight.\"\nThat looks like requiring greater US involvement closer to the frontline. Gen Petraeus is reluctant to give details.\n\"Should there be US advisors with Iraqi forces below the divisional  level?\" he asks. \"Should there be joint teams of tactical air controllers on the ground with security and other assets to support them?\n\"Does there need to be an augmentation of the train-and-equip effort? Can we accelerate the delivery of some of the equipment that Iraq so desperately needs?\"\nIt sounds like the elements of a blueprint for a re-invigorated US effort. But then again - typical Petraeus - there is the political dimension.\n\"Are we doing all that we can to empower and support those Iraqi leaders, starting with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who recognise the need to bring the Sunni Arab population back into the fabric of Iraqi society? And, most importantly, are our military elements and structures sufficiently supporting the political component and vice versa?\"\nIn response to my comment that all this could have been said a year ago - Gen Petraeus responded by saying that he did indeed say it all a year ago. This is not about re-inventing the wheel.\n\"We need to see the same elements of this (previous) comprehensive civil-military counter- insurgency campaign, albeit today with the Iraqis playing the key roles, enabled by the Americans.\"\nGen Petraeus acknowledges the difficulties of grappling with the horrors in Syria but insists that the only way forward is to train and equip moderate opposition elements. He says that more such fighters will spring up once the programme gets under way.\nAnd he is very cautious about any Iranian role in combating IS. He insists Iran remains a revolutionary power in the region.\n\"This is a country that has made progress because of chaos. It has both benefited from chaos and fomented chaos to try to achieve regional hegemony,\" he says.\nSo he believes that \"while there can indeed be some coincidence of interest between the US, its coalition allies in the region and Iran in terms of the defeat of IS (...) the over-arching context is one that gives you reason to have considerable caution in how you go forward in the relationship with Iran\".\nGen Petraeus still travels to Iraq regularly. He knows the key players well. And though out of uniform and established in a civilian career as an adviser, he remains the man who did achieve a kind of success in Iraq.\nThat is a commodity that is in short supply today for the Americans and the Iraqi authorities. This  makes the Petraeus approach an attractive model.\nBut the question remains: Can the outcome be the same with the Iraqi military cast in the role of the Americans?\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Ex-CIA Director David Petraeus has told the BBC that Islamic State militants can only be defeated through a dual military and political approach.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

But these new attacks are the most significant yet - rebel forces are attacking key front lines, and there have been repeated air strikes by the Syrian military.\nThis upsurge in fighting is putting new pressure on fragile peace talks. Opposition delegates are now discussing if the time has come to leave Geneva - they are reported to have received a letter from rebel forces on the ground, urging them to exert more pressure on the UN envoy Staffan de Mistura who has been mediating in these indirect negotiations between the warring sides.\nThe opposition is now accusing the UN of bias after Mr de Mistura floated a proposal to allow Syria's President Assad  to remain in office, in a ceremonial role.\nI've heard that idea in recent months from Russian and Iranian sources. But Syrian opposition groups have flatly rejected it - their Western backers are urging them not to walk out but it is becoming increasingly clear that these talks are not going anywhere.\nThe HNC wanted to express its disappointment at the deterioration in the humanitarian situation and in the cessation of hostilities, Mr de Mistura said.\nBut the envoy added that the HNC would remain in Geneva and informal discussions with the two sides would continue with a view to \"taking stock\" on Friday.\nThe US on Monday called on Russia to use its influence on the Syrian government to stop attacks that threatened the seven-week cessation of hostilities as well as the Geneva peace talks, a State Department official said.\nSeparately, President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin held an \"intense conversation\" on Monday that covered Syria, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.\nMeanwhile, four Syrians including three children in the Turkish town of Kilis were killed in rocket fire from Syrian territory controlled by co-called Islamic State (IS), the local governor's office said.\nThe Turkish military fired artillery in response, Hurriyet newspaper reported.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that rebels had launched an assault on the positions of government forces and their allies in Latakia's northern countryside early on Monday and by midday had made advances.\nThe UK-based monitoring group also said rebels were close to taking over the town of Khirbat al-Naqus, in the strategically important Sahl al-Ghab plain in the north-west of Hama province.\nA Syrian military source confirmed the attacks, according to the Reuters news agency.\nLatakia is the heartland of President Bashar al-Assad's Alawite sect, and the Sahl al-Ghab lies just to the east of the coastal mountains where Mr Assad's ancestral village of Qardaha is located.\nMeanwhile, the Syrian Observatory said four people were killed in heavy government air strikes in northern Homs province.\nTwenty-two civilians were killed over the weekend in Aleppo, with at least 16 dying as a result of rebel shell- and sniper-fire and the six others dying in government air strikes, according to the group.\nMilitants from the group known as Islamic State (IS), which along with the rival jihadist group al-Nusra Front is excluded from the cessation of hostilities, have meanwhile seized more territory from rebel groups near the Turkish border north of Aleppo, forcing some 35,000 civilians to flee towards the opposition-held town of Azaz.\nMedecins Sans Frontieres warned on Monday that the situation was now critical for more than 100,000 displaced people trapped around Azaz, with active fighting just 7km (four miles) away and the border closed for all but the most seriously ill Syrians.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Rebels say they have begun a new battle in north-western Syria in response to alleged truce violations by the army.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

People should think about their own conduct.\n\"If you are grossly abusive to people, if you are bullying or harassing people online, then we will prosecute in the same way as if you did it offline.\"\nHowever, Ms Saunders said context will be an important factor in decisions - for example \"if you're offensive, the legislation would say you have to be grossly offensive, and that's quite a high test\".\nOne woman, who wished to remain anonymous, said she and her daughter, who has Down's Syndrome, had suffered such severe online abuse over the last six years that they had to move house three times.\nThe abuse started, she said, when a friend wrote a book about trolls - anonymously but mentioning her by name.\n\"The trolls photoshopped images of myself and my daughter on to pornography and posted it on Facebook. They have said I'm a paedophile and called her hateful names like mongoloid; they even set up a website in her name.\"\nThe woman believes the trolls kept getting hold of her details using official forms she submitted when complaining at the use of images of her daughter.\n\"Even after we moved, they have called us at three of four in the morning threatening to petrol-bomb our house if we will not give up the name of the author.\n\"It's been horrific - this trolling is not free speech; it's hate speech,\" she said.\nShe added that one of the men stood outside the family home and followed her daughter to school, taking pictures.\nThe incidents are now being investigated by police.\nKevin Healey told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he had been abused online for five years over his autism campaign work.\nHe said: \"Not even one troll has been prosecuted or jailed, even though I have made complaints to Twitter and the police.\n\"It's been a nightmare; it's been horrific - it doesn't go away. It's with you 24 hours and seven days a week, there's no escape from it\".\nMr Healey said he doesn't think the changes will make any difference and wants changes to legislation in the UK - and abroad.\n\"With the laws in the UK, if someone is trolling you from outside the UK - and my last batch of trolls were from the US - the police said we can't do anything,\" he added.\nThe CPS says it will use \"considerable caution\" before charging those posting \"grossly offensive\" material.\nThe changes come after a report found that one in four teenagers is abused online over their sexual orientation, race, religion, gender or disability.\nThe CPS also said underage \"sexting\" between consenting children in a relationship should not be prosecuted, but cases which involve \"exploitation, grooming or bullying\" may lead to legal action.\nMs Saunders told the BBC: \"If they are children, they are the same age, there's no suggestion or any coercion or bad motives, then we would not expect that case to be prosecuted. It shows you how careful you have to be about the context of it,\" she said.\nAsked about whether guidelines on misogynistic hate crimes would be introduced, Ms Saunders said: \"We probably need to think about it.\"\nA new law on revenge porn - someone uploading explicit images or film of a former partner to humiliate or embarrass them - has led to the prosecution of 206 people across England and Wales since its introduction in April 2015.\nThe public policy statements on hate crime will be subject to public consultation for 13 weeks.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Internet trolls who create derogatory hashtags or doctored images to humiliate others could face prosecution in England and Wales.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The son of a farmer then put on his pheran, the woollen cape-like garment Kashmiris wear, and quietly left for his Sunday lessons.\nA few hours later, Faizan lay dead near a sun-baked school playground, ringed by bare walnut and willow trees. Paramilitary soldiers, eyewitnesses alleged, had shot him in the back of his head.\nCarrying a packet of biscuits, he was returning home on a bright, nippy morning when he encountered a throng of local people protesting against Indian rule near the school, where polling was taking place for a parliamentary by-election.\nEyewitnesses say four shots rang out of the single-storey, squat school building which, according to some reports, was being pelted with stones thrown by protesters from a hill above and from the road in front.\nFaizan possibly halted to find out what the commotion was all about, and was hit by a bullet. Two neighbours ran up to his home to deliver the news. His mother had sprinted down to the playground, hugged her bleeding son and let others take him to hospital.\n\"I knew he was gone,\" Zarifa told me.\nA heart-wrenching video recorded by a villager on his mobile phone minutes after the killing shows a wailing man cradling the dead boy, blood streaming down his broken face, in a packed vehicle taking him to the nearest hospital. There, the doctors declared him dead.\nFaizan's final journey is recorded on another mobile phone video: his slight frame, draped in white, bobbing slightly on a hospital cot, carried through a sea of weeping, agitated mourners extolling their latest \"martyr\". By late afternoon, his body was lowered into the grave near his village, Dalwan.\nFaizan was among the eight people killed on Sunday when paramilitary soldiers fired bullets and shotgun pellets at those protesting against Indian rule at polling centres near Srinagar, the summer capital. Election authorities say some 170 people, including 100 security personnel, were injured in about 200 incidents of stone pelting and violent protests on the day.\nThe voter turnout in Sunday's election was an abysmal 7.1% - the lowest in decades - and came as a huge setback for the region's mainstream parties.\nThe soldiers had been brought in from other states to secure polling stations and may have been unprepared to deal with \"protests and provocation\" in a complex conflict zone like Kashmir, a senior official told me.\nOne report said the police had registered complaints against the paramilitary forces for firing into the crowds.\nSeparatist groups had rejected the elections and urged voters to boycott Sunday's poll, which took place after a politician resigned over what he described as the \"anti-people\" agenda of the Indian government.\nDisillusioned voters - even in relatively peaceful places like Dalwan where people turned out to cast their votes enthusiastically in previous elections - generally stayed away.\nWhy Faizan was killed on a day when local voters rejected the ballot is not clear.\nBy all accounts, he was not pelting stones or hurling abuse at the soldiers. One report said police fired tear gas shells to keep the protesters away from the empty polling station, but the soldiers opened fire.\nWhatever it is, Faizan became another grisly statistic in Kashmir's unending tragedy.\nA picture taken by his friend on his mobile phone during their winter break shows the shy-looking boy - \"he would often top his class, and he was very knowledgeable about the world,\" the friend said - clad in a woollen cap and collared jacket, peering uneasily into the camera.\n\"He was quiet and studious, he was doing well in school. He played cricket, and counted [former Indian captain] MS Dhoni as his favourite cricketer. He wanted to become a doctor,\" a cousin told me, when I visited the family.\nGrief is the price one pays for love. Zarifa's lament for her dead son filled the still air inside a tent outside their home where local women had gathered to mourn.\n\"My son, my son, where will I find you now?\" she cried, again and again.\nThen she stepped out of the tent, entered her home and joined her husband in a dank, cold room. He sat there, stoic and numb, surrounded by mourners, and gazed vacantly at the pastel pink walls. The room had a red carpet and red window curtains.\n\"The blood of a martyr never goes waste,\" said Fayaz Ahmad Dar. \"One day, the blood of innocents will help us gain our freedom [from Indian rule].\"\nA brief silence followed. Zarifa broke it, bemoaning the loss of her boy.\n\"I am looking at your books, I am looking at your school bags. How will I touch your books again, my son? Everybody would talk about your intelligence, how you would answer every question with so much wit.\"\nOutside the secondary school - Enter to learn, Leave to serve, its motto, is engraved on the walls - a group of young men gathered later in the day. Their eyes seethed in anger. They spoke about frustration, alienation, desperation, humiliation and hopelessness.\nThey said they had lost their fear of life. They insisted that they helped rebels because \"they are our brothers and don't kill civilians\" and are \"fighting for freedom\".\nMore than half of them raised their hands when asked whether they had pelted stones at Indian forces.\n\"We are not safe in our own homes, we are not safe on streets. They are killing little boys now. Life is uncertain,\" said Feroze Ali, a school clerk.\nSince February alone, some two dozen civilians have been killed during gunfights between armed rebels and security forces. The security forces have accused civilians of helping rebels escape.\nThe army says it has tried to reach out and engage with civilians through its 29 schools, youth clubs and cricket tournaments.\nRecently some 19,000 Kashmiri young men applied for a few hundred vacancies in the army.\n\"Provocation and panic can lead to accidents. Security forces often fire when they face life threatening situations. But protecting civilians remains our first priority in this situation. When a civilian dies, it hurts us,\" an army officer told me.\nThe region has seen heightened tension and increased unrest since July when influential militant Burhan Wani was killed by Indian forces. More than 100 civilians lost their lives in clashes with protesters during a four-month-long lockdown, including a 55-day-curfew, in the restive Muslim-majority valley.\nKashmir, clearly, appears to be teetering on the brink of an open public revolt against Indian rule.\nMany say the federal government's near-complete lack of engagement and dialogue with local stakeholders and Pakistan, a complete mistrust of the local government and a lack of development and jobs have left most people jittery and alienated.\nMilitancy continues to be at low ebb - there are an estimated 250 militants in the state now of which 150 are local - compared to several thousand during the peak of insurgency in the 1990s.\nBut young Kashmiris - more than 60% of the men in the valley are under 30, and more than 40% of men in Kashmir are jobless - are restless and angry. The local political parties are in danger of \"becoming irrelevant\", as a leader of an opposition party told me.\n\"This is the worst situation that I have seen. Earlier, it was a movement led by the militants. Now it is being led by the people,\" says Feroze Ali, 35, a schoolteacher.\n\"India needs to be worried, very worried about this.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "The day 12-year-old Faizan Fayaz Dar died, he woke up in the morning in his hilltop home in Budgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, had a cup of salted tea, recited the Koran and pottered around in the kitchen where his mother prepared breakfast for the family.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

It did not have the power to do so when the all-Wales franchise was awarded to Arriva.\nThe model this time will focus on what level and quality of service the various bidders can offer. They will be asked to outline what they will do to drive up the numbers of passengers taking trains and buses across Wales.\nWhile the Metro for south Wales will be part of the bid, the company's proposals will also be scrutinised in terms of how they will affect all geographical locations.\nWhichever company wins will have a cap set on how much profit they can make. We do not yet know at what level that will be set but once that is passed remaining profit will go to the body responsible - Transport for Wales - to be reinvested in public transport in Wales. That cap will be for negotiation.\nEach company is expected to put together its own particular mix of heavy rail, bus and possibly light rail. The preferred contractor is expected to be known by early 2018.\nNegotiations are underway with Network Rail about handing over responsibility for the track on the core Valleys lines to the franchise holder.\nThe current franchise is run by Arriva Trains Wales which gets a subsidy from the Welsh Government of between \u00a3150m and \u00a3180m a year.\nRail privatisation laws stop the Welsh Government giving the contract to public sector bodies.\nThe Welsh Government has lobbied for more powers, but said its requests have been turned down in Westminster.\nOfficials said in time TfW may evolve to take on more responsibilities, similar to Transport for London.\nEconomy Secretary Ken Skates said new trains, quicker journeys and modernised technology were priorities for the franchise.\n\"We now have four highly skilled, experienced companies entering the next, competitive phase and I am keen to hear more from them about what they can offer Wales and how they can deliver on our plans for integrated public transport,\" he said.\n\"Over the next 10 years I envisage significant strides in the delivery of our public transport network including the electrification of the Swansea, Valleys and north Wales lines, a South and North Wales Metro and widespread structural improvements that are already in the pipeline.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Four foreign-owned firms are competing to run train services in Wales and create the \u00a3600m South Wales Metro.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes.\n\"Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.\"\nEvans described Sir Terry as his \"radio dad\" and said that Radio 2 was \"in disbelief and shock\".\n\"He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,\" added Evans. \"He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.\"\nBBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry \"one of the greatest broadcasters of our age\".\n\"Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,\" he said.\n\"You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one.\n\"But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them.\"\nPrime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a \"wonderful human being\".\n\"I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour,\" he said.\nVeteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was \"stunned\" at the news and that his condolences were \"very much with Helen and the family\".\nSir Terry died surrounded by his family \"after a short but brave battle with cancer\", a statement released by his family said.\nHe leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy.\nAn online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning.\nThe city's mayor said: \"Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots.\n\"The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.\"\nPresident of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was \"always proud of his origins in Limerick\", and returned frequently to his native country.\nFamily friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was \"shocked\" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had \"put it out that he had a bad back\".\nThe Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin.\n\"I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money.\n\"For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,\" he added.\nSir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon.\nBlessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.\nHe also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.\nFrom 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.\nThe second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or \"Terry's Old Geezers and Gals\".\nTributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.\nBBC director general Lord Hall said: \"He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.\"\nRadio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was \"one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard\".\nSir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career.\nRadio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a \"radio genius\", saying: \"The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.\"\nSir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account.\nThe singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: \"Such a special and funny man.\n\"A brilliant broadcaster and presenter.

You have allowed me to share your lives with you.\n\"When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving.

Jamala dedicated it to her great-grandmother and her five children, who were deported by Soviet troops from Crimea in 1944.\nSimon Bennett, head of the International OGAE Eurovision fan club, told the BBC that former Soviet countries that would \"normally vote for Russia\" had sent it a message by voting for Ukraine instead.\nPolitical songs are not allowed at Eurovision, but 1944 was permitted because it was based on historic fact, rather than current politics.\nBBC Music reporter Mark Savage wrote in February that Ukraine's 2004 Eurovision winner, Ruslana, had said the song 1944 had struck a chord over current circumstances in the region.\n\"This song... is precisely what we are all suffering in Ukraine today,\" she said, referencing Russia's seizure of Crimea in 2014.\nJamala simply said after her win: \"I want peace and love for everyone,\" adding at the press conference: \"I was sure that if you talk about truth it really can touch people.\"\nBut John Kennedy O'Connor, broadcaster, author and Eurovision expert, was not happy with Saturday's result.\n\"I'm disappointed that a dirge about genocide and delivering a pointed slap in Russia's face has won this year,\" he told the BBC.\n\"This contest should never be a political platform and I'm almost angry that it's been turned into one, despite the very clear rule book on the matter.\"\nHe said that while third place was an \"excellent result\", the Russians must be \"sick as parrots\" at the moment.\nAlasdair Rendall, president of the Eurovision fan club OGAE UK, said immediate reaction to Jamala's victory was \"mixed\".\n\"Many people admired her strong voice and the impressive visuals on show,\" he told the BBC.\n\"However many are already saying it won due to the strong political message it carried rather than its musical quality.\"\nAs for Australia, Bennett said it was \"neutral and easy to give your votes to\" while O'Connor said it was \"time for them to go away and start AsiaVision now\", referring to a song contest for Asia Pacific countries.\nAnd at the other end of the leaderboard, hopes for the UK's Joe and Jake were dashed when they came third from bottom.\nRendall felt the result was \"totally undeserved\" and Bennett was \"distraught for them\".\nBut O'Connor added: \"The fact that their single is not in the UK top 100 after a month [plus] since its release says it all really.\"\nJoe and Jake told the BBC they had given \"it their all\" and sent \"huge congratulations\" to Jamala.\nThe new voting system also got a mixed reception, with Bennett saying it was \"a disaster that destroyed the atmosphere\"' while Rendall said it had \"really ramped up the tension\".\nIt seems that the only thing everyone agreed on was the show itself.\n\"Congratulations to Swedish TV for putting on one of the most impressive, exciting and high quality Eurovisions ever,\" said Rendall.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "So Ukraine confounded the bookmakers and Eurovision commentators who had been convinced that Russia - or possibly Australia - would win.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

This is because of a perverse incentive in the system which ministers now want to rectify.\nMeanwhile, travelling to the UK deliberately for health treatment - so-called health tourism - is not allowed.\nThe rules are less clear in other cases, such as expats and asylum seekers.\nThe latest research is published in two separate reports by firms Prederi and Creative Research.\nThe government has been criticised for using financial estimates from the Prederi report, but Mr Hunt said it was the \"most thorough research there has ever been\" in this area.\nThe report itself notes that it is based on \"incomplete data, sometimes of varying quality, and a large number of assumptions\", but it says the estimates are the \"best that can be made at present\", and Mr Hunt said researchers had been \"completely honest about what they do know and what they don't know\".\nThe government is currently consulting on the measures it will take to tackle this issue.\nIt has already announced a \u00a3200-a-year levy on migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) staying for between six months and five years, and Mr Hunt said this could raise \u00a3200m a year.\nA cost-recovery unit will also be set up to help hospitals claw back money they are owed by other governments for treating foreign nationals visiting the UK.\nMeanwhile, \"deliberate health tourism\" - whereby people travel to the UK to get NHS care - is estimated by Prederi to cost between \u00a360m and \u00a380m a year. The report's authors concede this figure is \"uncertain\" and the \"plausible range\" of the cost is \u00a320m-\u00a3100m.\nFrequent visitors \"taking advantage\" by registering with GPs and getting access to prescriptions and some hospital referrals cost the NHS a further \u00a350m-\u00a3200m a year, the report adds.\nThe government accepts it cannot recoup all of this money and entirely stop health tourism and so it has put forward the \"conservative\" \u00a3500m figure.\nTo achieve this, it said a better system of identifying when visitors and migrants got treatment was needed. More details on what this will involve will be revealed in the coming weeks.\nFree NHS care is offered to anyone with living in the UK who has temporary or permanent permission to do so.\nAsylum seekers, non-EEA nationals who do not have permission to live in the UK, British ex-pats and visitors usually have to pay for treatment.\nThe UK has reciprocal agreements with most European nations and 28 other countries, and under these visitors are given free NHS care.\nThe NHS should claim these costs back from the relevant governments - but the research suggests just \u00a373m a year is recouped out of more than \u00a3460m at present.\nThis is because there is a perverse incentive in the system whereby if they declare the fact they have treated a foreign national it is up to the individual hospital to chase up the home nation for the money whereas if they do not declare it they get money from the NHS system for seeing a patient entitled to care.\nShadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: \"We are not against improving the recovery of costs from people with no entitlement to NHS treatment.\"\nBut he added the figures were based on a \"large number of assumptions\" and was more about \"spin than substance\".\nDr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs committee, said the government's \u00a3500m savings figure was \"exaggerated\", partly because it did not take account of the costs of implementing its plans.\nHe said migrants paying the proposed \u00a3200-a-year levy could be more likely to use the NHS to \"get their money's worth\", and he said the cost of a single hospital outpatient appointment would be more than \u00a3200.\nDr Nagpaul said doctors should not be distracted from their work in order to check the eligibility of patients for treatments.\nDr Clare Gerada, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said it was imperative GPs were not tasked with being a \"new border agency\" in policing the NHS.\n\"The risks to public health that will arise from these proposals are also very real. They will deter people from seeking medical help in the early stages of illness when they can be dealt with cost-effectively and efficiently in primary care, rather than requiring expensive specialist care and increasing admissions to emergency departments,\" she said.\nJonathan Portes, of the Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank, said the research revealed the extent of deliberate health tourism had been \"hugely overstated\" and was in fact a \"very small part of NHS expenditure\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Up to \u00a3500m could be recovered from overseas visitors and migrants using the NHS every year, ministers believe.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

He was working out how long 30-year-olds could expect to live.\nHis findings show men languishing far behind for decades, but now starting to get closer to women. If current trends continue, Prof Mayhew predicts, both sexes could, on average, be living to the age of 87 in 2030.\nHe said: \"What's interesting at the moment is that in the last 20 years or so, male life expectancy at 30 has jumped by about six years and if it jumps by the same amount in the next 20 years it will converge with female life expectancy.\"\nThe reason could be down to men living a healthier lifestyle. \"One of the main reasons, I think, is the trend in the prevalence of smoking. Smoking took off after 1920 in the male population and at its high about 80% of males smoked.\n\"This was reflected in more divergence in the life expectancy, so by the time you get to about 1970 it was at its peak - the difference in life expectancy was about 5.7 years.\"\nOther factors are thought to be safer, more office-based, jobs. Millions of men used to work in hazardous occupations such as coal mining. Healthcare has meant more men live longer as well. People with heart disease, which is more common in men, can expect to live much longer than they did a few decades ago.\nBy contrast, women started smoking later than men.  \n, but are falling fast in men.\nA boy and a girl born on the same day will still not have the same life expectancies, as the study looked only at people who had already reached 30. Boys are more likely to die in their first year of life and are more likely to take up dangerous sports or be involved in fatal accidents.\nIt means that women could still have the edge for some time to come.\nProf David Leon, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \"In virtually all countries in the world, women do have a slight advantage.\"\nHowever, he said the gap was definitely closing in some countries.\nCountries with lower levels of life expectancy, such as in sub-Saharan Africa, showed very little difference between the genders. This was due to the prevalence of infectious diseases which \"are not picky about men and women\", he said.\nIn countries that had defeated most infectious diseases, such as in Eastern Europe, \"there is a much bigger difference, mostly dominated by lifestyle factors\".\nAt one point in the 1990s, the gap between life expectancies in Russia reached 13 years. Prof Leon said it was an \"absolutely massive\" difference in a \"very gendered society\".\nIn his third class of countries, such as the UK, the gap in life expectancies is starting to narrow.\nHe said: \"Men are getting a bit better behaved and women are adopting male life expectancies.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "The gap between male and female life expectancy is closing and men could catch up by 2030, according to an adviser for the Office for National Statistics.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

And a China expert.\nWriting about the country's economic slowdown in 2012, he said: \"China's debt fuelled expansion was never likely to be sustainable.\"\nThe amber warning lights came back on this morning when the ratings agency Moody's downgraded China's credit rating, its investor benchmark for analysing the country's economic performance.\nNow, the rating is still A1 - the agency's fifth highest - but nevertheless does highlight growing concerns about the amount of debt the world's most populous country is carrying.\nThe problem is not the government's direct debt, which at less than 40% of GDP is modest by Western standards, or the eminently manageable 3% deficit (the rate at which that debt is rising).\nThe issue is the debt being carried by the country's companies, or more specifically the \"state-owned enterprises\" (SOEs) that constitute the grumbling and sometimes out-of-date engines of the Chinese economy.\nAnd the debts being carried by the country's local governments - which, of course, in a state the size of China, are a little more significant than those of an English town council, say.\nHere, the picture is different.\nSOE debt stands at 115% of GDP, a figure that is steadily rising and is far higher than, say, comparable figures for Japan and South Korea (where comparable debts are around 30%).\nMoody's estimates that bringing the leverage of those firms down to more manageable levels would cost more than $400bn (\u00a3308bn).\nAt the same time, China's own finance ministry has warned that some local authorities are struggling to meet day-to-day operating costs, as they find themselves caught between supporting often inefficient local businesses - making steel, for example - or funding the unpaid debts and unemployment costs associated with shutting down or reforming the mainstays of regional economies.\nNow, China certainly has deep pockets.\nIts foreign currency reserves stand at more than $3tn and its annual current account surplus is $200bn.\nSo, debt sustainability is not a near and present danger.\nBut, if the old joke is that when America sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold, when it comes to China, it only has to think about reaching for its handkerchief and the global economy can suffer a fit of the vapours.\nWhen China announced weaker-than-expected economic data at the beginning of 2016, world stock markets went into free fall and commodity prices tumbled.\nIn 2010, average Chinese growth hovered around 10%. It is now between 6% and 7%.\nMore manageable than the heady days of seven years ago, yes, but there are fears that a lack of economic reform could see growth fall to 5% as President Xi Jinping balances the drive for a more efficient economy (with all the dislocating restructuring costs and possible job losses that could incur) with the need to keep political tension to a minimum.\nIn a jittery world, China's debt mountain can loom larger than the fundamentals suggest.\nAnd Moody's downgrade is just one straw in the wind.\nAsian stock markets hardly paused for breath when it was announced earlier this morning and warnings of a \"hard landing\" for the Chinese economy have been oft-predicted and not materialised.\nBut, Chinese bond yields are rising as investors demand a higher risk premium for funding the government's liabilities.\nThere is no need to rush for the lifeboats yet.\nHowever, it's probably worth knowing where they are.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "In his new book Grave New World, Stephen King says: \"For better or worse, China is simply too big to be ignored.\"", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Fitzel has overseen improved fortunes at all levels of the game after the country missed on qualification for the 2010 World Cup.\nSince then, the Czech Republic were quarter-finalists in the 2012 European Championships and finished top of their Euro 2016 qualifying group.\n\"If we did not have a 16-team league and we only had 12, only a few youth players would get a chance,\" Fitzel told BBC Scotland.\n\"The bigger the league, the more teams are playing at a higher level, and the more young players are getting a chance. The more they play, the more they improve through experience of playing in the top league.\"\nFrom next season, the Czech First League will be ranked nine places above Scotland in the Uefa coefficient rankings, with two teams qualifying for the Champions League qualifiers.\nHowever, Fitzel admits a 16-team league does have its pitfalls and they could end up moving in the opposite direction.\n\"Currently here in the Czech Republic we are discussing maybe having 10 or 12 teams playing each other four times,\" Fitzel said. \"At the moment we do not play enough games.\n\"A 16-team league has allowed us to have a winter break of two-and-a-half months. We finish at the end of December and start again at the beginning of March. But it means we only play 14 games in spring and all the clubs are saying we should have more games.\n\"In a smaller league, maybe there are more interesting games. We are looking at the ice hockey league, where right now they have play-offs and the stadia there is sold-out; even the relegation play-offs. That's fantastic income for the clubs and the stadiums hold 13,000 - 15,000 people.\"\nFitzel, like many in Europe, has looked on with interest at the Scottish game in the last few years. He says the 12-12-18 set-up that was proposed in 2013 was interesting, but feels clubs should listen to what the supporters want.\n\"It's an interesting idea,\" he added. \"It is something new, and I always feel if you don't try it then you don't know.\n\"From my point of view it is interesting to play for relegation or promotion. It could be a long period of games.\n\"It seems interesting, but the question is do the people want to see this?\n\"If you have enough teams for a 16 top division, they don't need to be equal.

Changes to body colour and other behaviour were interpreted as tactics to avoid predators.\nBut Prof Peter Godfrey-Smith said the unique study, based on 53 hours of footage and published on Friday in the journal Current Biology, provided a novel perspective on octopus behaviour.\n\"[An aggressive] octopus will turn very dark, stand in a way that accentuates its size and it will often seek to stand on a higher spot,\" Prof Godfrey-Smith, who co-authored the report, said.\n\"Clearly the unusual stance is not a physiological response. It makes it look as big as it can possibly be, with its arms spread out below and the mantle, the back part of the animal, raised over the head.\n\"The dark colour is produced in concert with those size-accentuating behaviours. There's no particular physiological reason why darkness should be associated with aggression, but it does give the impression of a larger object.\"\nThe researchers, based in Australia and the US, dubbed the stance the \"Nosferatu pose\", referring to the classic 1920s horror film, because the spread of the octopus's web was reminiscent of a vampire's cape.\nOctopuses frequently turned pale while retreating from aggressors and also produced high-contrast patterns known as deimatic displays.\nThe contrasting patterns were most frequently observed when octopuses were attempting to return to their den after they had been forced out, or in the presence of an aggressive individual.\n\"Suppose there's a large, aggressive guy there and you want to get back into our den, if you approach with a pale colour it could be interpreted as a non-confrontational behaviour,\" Prof Godfrey-Smith said.\nThe study also found that two octopuses displaying dark colours were likely to fight if in close proximity, while a darker-coloured octopus was likely to stand its ground against a lighter-coloured octopus.\nAnother cephalopod, the cuttlefish, shows a similar set of features, with aggressive males darkening their faces and paler males withdrawing from fights.\nThe unusually high number of octopuses living together in the colony off Jervis Bay, south of Sydney, allowed a more in-depth observation of interactions than had previously been possible.\nProf Godfrey-Smith's co-author David Scheel and his students combed through 53 hours of footage and observed 186 interactions between the octopuses.\nThis included the Nosferatu pose, along with reaching, grappling and mating.\nWatching these long videos was \"much more exhausting than I expected\", Prof Godfrey Smith said.\n\"Identifying an individual from minute to minute is very difficult, because they change colour and shape.\n\"If the octopus wanders out of the frame, there's not much you can do.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Octopuses may have more complex social interactions than previously believed, a new study has found.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

A California neighbour said he liked it so much he stayed.\nNotes produced in court, apparently in Mr Miller's handwriting, suggested he had become a fugitive because he was involved with Wikileaks, the organisation that leaked US state secrets.\nHowever, the BBC's Stephen Evans in Seoul says it is unclear if they were written under duress or not, and if any of the allegations were true.\nIn an interview this month with CNN, attended by North Korean officials, Mr Miller said: \"I will say that I prepared to violate the law of the DPRK before coming here.\"\nHe also said he deliberately committed his \"crime\", without specifying what he had done wrong.\nThe charges he faced in trial were non-specified.\nMr Bae, a Korean-American known in North Korea as Pae Jun-ho, was arrested in November 2012 as he entered the north-eastern port city of Rason, a special economic zone near North Korea's border with China.\nHe has been described as both a tour operator and Christian missionary. North Korea said he used his tourism business to form groups to overthrow the government.\nHe was sentenced to 15 years' hard labour in May 2013.\nMr Bae's trial and conviction came at a time of high tension between the US and North Korea, in the wake of the communist state's third nuclear test. So far efforts to secure his release have been unsuccessful.\nHis family say he has several health complaints including diabetes and liver problems.\nJeffrey Edward Fowle: June 2014 - October 2014\nJeffrey Fowle entered North Korea on 29 April and was detained as he was leaving the country some time between mid-May and early June, according to reports.\nHe is a 56-year-old US citizen from Miamisburg, Ohio, who works for the city.\nThe father of three came into the country as a tourist but, according to reports, left a Bible in his hotel room - something the North considers incendiary.\nHe was facing a trial for non-specified charges but was released following negotiations and returned to the US in October 2014.\nMr Jun, a businessman, was arrested in November 2010 for an unspecified \"grave crime\", and detained in North Korea for six months.\nIt was reported that he may have been involved in missionary work during business trips to North Korea.\nThe communist state views organised religious activity as a potential challenge to its leadership.\nNorth Korean state media said that he had confessed to wrongdoing, and that he was treated well in custody, being allowed diplomatic contact and family phone calls.\nVisiting US officials repeatedly requested his release, including Robert King, the US special envoy for human rights, who was visiting North Korea to assess its food situation.\nDuring Mr King's visit, the North agreed to free Mr Jun on \"humanitarian grounds\".\nMr Jun was flown out with Mr King's delegation.\nThe US had suspended its food aid to North Korea in 2009 amid concerns over the North's nuclear programme, and Mr King stressed that Pyongyang had not been promised aid in return for Mr King's release.\nAijalon Mahli Gomes, 31, was sentenced to eight years' hard labour for illegally entering North Korea from China in 2010.\nHe had been teaching English in South Korea, but reportedly crossed into North Korea in January 2010.

International investigators said that the vessel had been sunk by a North Korean torpedo, something Pyongyang denied.\nSoon afterwards, the US and South Korea took part in joint military drills, sparking anger from North Korea.\nSix-party talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear programme had also been stalled for several months.\nFormer US President Jimmy Carter secured Mr Gomes' release during a \"private humanitarian trip\" to North Korea in August 2010.\nDuring his trip, he met North Korean officials, including ceremonial head of state Kim Yong-nam.\nNorth Korean media said that Kim Yong-nam expressed North Korea's commitment to resuming six-party negotiations on its nuclear programme, during his talks with Mr Carter.\nUS Christian activist Robert Park entered North Korea on 25 December 2009, carrying a letter for then-North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.\nHe crossed into North Korea from China by walking over a frozen river. He was arrested almost instantly.\nHe told the BBC he had decided to make the trip because his conscience had been tormented by the thought of people suffering in North Korea.\nHe said he was tortured while in custody.\nIn February, North Korea said it had decided to \"forgive and release\" Mr Park.\nNorth Korean media said he confessed to crossing the border, and agreed that his view of North Korea was based on false reports.\nHe now realised that religious freedom was ensured in North Korea, North Korea's main news agency added - something his colleagues described as \"propaganda\".\nLaura Ling and Euna Lee, reporters for California-based Current TV, were jailed for illegally entering North Korea and sentenced to 12 years' hard labour.\nThey had been filming a video about North Korean refugees, and admitted to entering North Korea for a short time, but said they were on the Chinese side of the border when they were arrested.\n\"We were firmly back inside China when the soldiers apprehended us,\" they said.\n\"We tried with all our might to cling to bushes, ground, anything that would keep us on Chinese soil, but we were no match for the determined soldiers.\"\nThey said it was possible that they had been lured into a trap.\nTheir detention took place during a period of high tensions between Pyongyang and Washington.

The families later left to settle in other parts of the Highlands.\nWith help from High Life Highland, which runs Inverness Museum, Mr MacMillan researched his family's history and was able to add new details to what he already knew about his grandmother.\nShe and various members of her family went on to settle in and around Kilmorack, near Beauly, and Achnagart in Glen Shiel.\nThose who worked with Mr MacMillan in the research were Anne Fraser, family historian at the Highland Archive Centre, and Cait McCullagh, curator at the museum.\nJim Hunter, emeritus professor of history at the University of the Highlands and Islands and an author of books on the clearances, also assisted in researching the significance of the Croick Decanter.\nTo mark the relic's donation an event will be held at Inverness Museum and Art Gallery on 27 August.\nProf Hunter will deliver a talk called Indelible Characters: Relics and remnants of Highland Clearance times.\nStarting in the late 18th Century and running into the 19th Century, the Highland Clearances saw townships occupied by generations of families cleared to make way for large-scale sheep farming and the rearing of deer.\nLandowners were seeking to \"improve\" their estates in line with the industrial revolution. Their hope was to make more capital from the land by running shooting estates, or starting industrial-scale livestock farming.\nIn some cases people who had lived on the land for generations left voluntarily, while others were forcibly evicted and their homes burned and demolished.\nThe clearances have influenced the stories of two new films.\nSlow West, a Western starring Michael Fassbender and Kodi Smit-McPhee and written and directed by Scotsman John Maclean, opened in UK cinemas in June.\nIts plot features a clearance based on forced evictions in Wester Ross.\nThe second film, a new short, will tell the story of Kate McPherson, who was among 80 people cleared off land in Sutherland and emigrated to Canada where they were settled in the Red River colony.\nOnce in Canada, they had to walk 100 mile (161km) to the colony in wintry conditions in handmade snowshoes.\nSutherland-born composer Robert Aitken is in the process of making the short film, Last Footsteps of Home.\nIt will be free of dialogue.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "A wine decanter taken from a church during the Highland Clearances and used by evicted families to feed milk to babies has been gifted to a museum.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

It mainly affects men over the age of 50.\nThe cancer can sometimes be treated successfully with hormone treatments, which target androgen receptors linked to the growth of male hormones called androgens.\nBut some prostate cancers don't work that way. Instead they create an abnormal form of androgen receptor which is not linked to the growth of hormones and therefore does not respond to standard hormone treatment.\nThis is the most common form of resistance in prostate cancer which leads to aggressive, difficult-to-treat cancers.\nThe latest research, published in the journal Cancer Research, found that a new class of drugs reduced production of both receptors.\nProfessor Paul Workman, study author and chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research, said it was an exciting discovery.\n\"We call Hsp90 inhibitors 'network drugs' because they tackle several of the signals that are hijacked in cancer all at once, across a network rather than just a single signalling pathway.\n\"These drugs can hit cancer harder than those targeting only one protein, and look promising for preventing or overcoming drug resistance.\"\nProf Workman said the next step was to test the Hsp90 inhibitors in clinical trials on patients with aggressive, drug-resistant prostate cancer.\nProf Johann de Bono, a professor of experimental cancer medicine at the Institute of Cancer Research, said: \"These drugs are already in clinical trials for several types of cancer, and I am excited that our work suggests they could also benefit men with prostate cancer who have otherwise run out of treatment options.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "A new type of drug could benefit men with aggressive prostate cancer that is no longer responding to treatment, researchers from the Institute of Cancer Research have said.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

In the UK, employees have the option of opting out of the directive.\nI'm a care worker who travels to different patients' homes. Am I affected?\nPossibly, yes.\nEmployees who fall into the category loosely defined as \"mobile workers\" - those who habitually travel to different places of work - could be affected.\nSimon Bond, an employment specialist at Higgs and Sons solicitors, says the most obvious group to fall under this definition is carers not already paid for travelling to their first and last jobs. Sales people who travel between sites and employee workmen and women, such as plumbers or electricians, could also fall into this category.\nAs many as 975,000 people in the UK could fall under the remit of the ruling, says Paul Sellers, a policy officer at the TUC.\nAnd some employees could be working an extra 10 hours a week once travelling time is counted, Chris Tutton, an employment lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, adds.\nI travel a lot for work, but I have a permanent office\nThe ruling is less likely to affect people who work both in an office and remotely. If your contract includes a permanent base, you are unlikely to be able to successfully argue you are a mobile worker, Mr Sellers says.\nThere may, however, be cases where it is possible to argue that a permanent base is meaningless because of the length of time spent outside the office.\nI have to commute two hours every day to my office\nFor those with a permanent office (however lengthy your commute), this ruling will not have an effect. Mr Sellers says this final group is the \"overwhelming majority\" in the UK.\nI think I'm affected. Should I expect a pay rise or a change in my hours?\nThe ruling could eventually affect pay. Unions say the ruling does not directly deal with remuneration, focussing instead on working hours and conditions. But it is possible the European judgement will be used in UK courts to challenge employers who pay an average hourly rate under the minimum wage (once travelling time is taken into account).\nThat could mean employers facing increased wage bills and raises an outside chance costs for some services, such as cleaners who have to travel and are paid a low wage, could go up.\nIt could also lead to a change in working patterns - especially for those who do not choose to opt out of the 48-hour maximum.\n\"I think some employers will look at where they're sending staff - they might try to make sure that the first and last shifts are as close to home as possible because they don't want to eat into that working time that they have,\" Mr Tutton said.\nWe have been contacted by BBC News website readers in response to the European judges' ruling.\nHere is a selection of their comments:\nThis is great news for the likes of me and my engineers. We work in the telecoms industry visiting multiple sites daily. We don't get paid travel time but are expected to be onsite for 9am and leave the last site at 5pm wherever that may be. If the sites are two hours away from home this adds four hours to our day that we don't get paid for, so we do a 12-hour day for eight hours work. Steve Carroll, Manchester\nI am a sales rep. My hours of work are 35, working nine to five. I leave my house most days at 6am as I work on the M25 strip so it takes three to four hours to get to my first appointment. I might get home at 7pm with no lunch break. I can drive for seven hours total per day, that's before my day working. I feel fed up, very tired and underpaid. I don't know what my rights are! Erica, Cambridge\nI am a pest control technician. My colleagues and I sometimes end up doing 11 or 12-hour days. These lost hours travelling can take its toll on missed family time. The amount of time driving both during the working day and the travelling time to and from work can sometimes be as much as six hours a day depending on where our jobs take us. Paul Godfrey, Swindon\nI currently leave for work - as a service engineer - earlier than my first job to ensure I'm at my first site by 10am. It's wrong that I should use my time as the further away it is the more my own time is used. We also do not have a structured break time and I've worked over 11 hours without a break and it's a constant driving service job. Barry Corbett, Glasgow\nI am a mobile gas fitter and I am expected to travel to my first appointment and from my last appointment in my own time which can add 10 hours to my working week. Mark Hannon, Castleford\nI'm a gas repair engineer. We have no offices. Our policy is to be on the patch of work or at our \"pickup\" point by 8am. With heavy traffic I leave home at 7.20am. This leaves me with 40 minutes of extra travel time. Also I could be working miles away from home at the end of day resulting in a huge variance of time out. Daniel Richards-Smith, Dorset\nI am a homecare worker, taking care of people in their own home. I do not get paid for travelling to work or in between appointments. Sometimes I can travel up to 50 miles a day. We get paid 30p per hour of care delivered in a day. This is not petrol money as the carers who walk between calls also get paid this. Sometimes we have to sit in our cars because it is too early to go in to the client, anywhere from 10 minutes to up to and hour as we often are too far away from home to make it feasible to travel home. Susan Turnbull, Barnsley\nI'm a healthcare assistant and while I agree with being paid for time it takes to travel I can also see this as having a knock on affect to the clients as the money to pay us would have to come from somewhere.

But now I can laugh.\"\nThe joke ended up being on Arsenal's attacking players rather than the unlikely trio of defenders that Van Gaal had picked - Chris Smalling, Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair - who surprisingly held out until Olivier Giroud's ferocious strike in stoppage time.\nSaturday evening's defeat was not the same old story for the Gunners either - they did not take the lead this time, for starters.\nAnd while we already knew that both teams are unlikely to mount a title challenge, there were still things to be learned from a game billed as the battle for fourth place.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIt had taken United until the 85th minute to muster a shot on target, with Kieran Gibbs' bizarre own goal gifting them the lead before Wayne Rooney's late strike prevented the game finishing with that odd statistic.\nAs well as his first away win as United boss, this was arguably the first win under Van Gaal that had been earned by his defence.\nArsene Wenger was keen to point out that David De Gea was man of the match at Emirates Stadium but in truth the United keeper made a lot of saves he would be expected to make, rather than any truly outstanding ones.\nOr as Van Gaal put it: \"Most of his saves were from outside the area and from that distance the goalkeeper has more advantage than the player shooting.\"\nThe biggest reason De Gea's recently dislocated finger was not truly tested was United's makeshift backline, something few people expected to be saying before this game when they saw the team sheet with the names of Smalling, McNair and Blackett on it.\nA fourth clean sheet of the season looked even less likely when one of the wing-backs, Luke Shaw, was forced off after 16 minutes to be replaced by Ashley Young - who according to his manager is not fully fit.\nAt that stage, Arsenal were rampant and it seemed a case of when they would score, not if. But instead of collapsing, United stood firm.\nSmalling, who is not viewed as natural leader, marshalled the youngsters either side of him. In front of them, Michael Carrick and Marouane Fellaini added much-needed bite to midfield.\nTogether they earned Van Gaal a win that moved his side up to fourth in the table - something he seemed surprised about when he was told.\nWhile United can - justifiably - claim to be making progress, the raw statistics demonstrate Arsenal are going backwards.\nA year ago, they beat Southampton 2-0 and were four points clear at the top of the table with 28 points from 12 games.\nFast forward 12 months and Wenger's men have 11 points fewer at the same stage, and trail leaders Chelsea by 15 points.\nYes, fourth place is still in their reach - United, in the last of the Champions League places, are only two points ahead. Framed like that, this campaign is not yet a disaster.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nBut after ending their trophy drought by winning the FA Cup, and following that up with a summer of heavy investment, Arsenal fans can be forgiven for thinking their title challenge should have lasted longer than it did last season, when it faded in the New Year.\nInstead it is all but over before most people have put their Christmas decorations up.\nSome are making their frustrations heard - such as the Gunners fan in front of the press box on Saturday who held aloft a sign reading \"Enough is Enough - Wenger out\".\nBut the majority remained with their manager on this occasion, perhaps because this defeat was unlike most of their setbacks this season.\nThis time, it was misfortune that cost them the initiative in a game, rather than any ill-advised attempts to extend their lead.\nGibbs' collision with Wojciech Szczesny that led to the full-back's own goal and ended the keeper's involvment in the game was pure farce.\nIt would be unkind to compare the duo's actions to the antics of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, the stars of new film 'Dumb and Dumber To' who were at Emirates Stadium to watch the game.\nBut you get the feeling their characters Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne would definitely have approved.\nUnited's second goal was much more familiar to Arsenal fans, with their team being caught up the pitch and exposed on the break - but at least this time it was because they were chasing the game.\nWenger's team have obvious shortcomings but they were not behind this defeat and his side did not get what they deserved against United. Instead it was just one of those nights.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Perhaps predictably, Louis van Gaal delivered the best line of the day as he reflected on how his side survived an early storm to beat Arsenal 2-1.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

He will go away happy and we will see a progression on what they did against Scotland over the next few games.\nThe tactics were more route one, using the forwards. Centre Jonathan Joseph didn't really get the ball and the wingers mainly got it from kick returns so there is still a bit of finesse for England to put around the back line.\nThe stats showed that England's set-piece was very good.\nCaptain Dylan Hartley's line-outs were brilliant (England only lost one of their 15) and they were clinical.\nJones has said he wants a strong set-piece game and he wants a strong, abrasive pack. They delivered that against Scotland.\nEngland also probably had two clear-cut chances to score tries and they took both of them.\nFrom that side it is all positives but I think Joseph will want to be in the game more.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nHis centre partner Owen Farrell wasn't in the game that much either and full-back Mike Brown wasn't his usual self. That will come but it is just going to take a bit of time.\nI am not massively sold on the combination of Owen Farrell and George Ford at fly-half and inside centre. If you have two number 10s who are out-and-out number 10s then both of them are spending too much time organising the game rather than carrying the ball.\nFarrell only carried the ball three times against Scotland and Joseph four. The midfield is not really functioning properly if that is happening. But at the same time, they linked up beautifully to put Jack Nowell in for a try.\nI would prefer an out-and-out inside centre who can also be a ball player rather than a fly-half playing there. At the moment it is a stop gap for England.\nI would prefer someone with a little bit more individual threat who can also do the distributing. Someone who is saying, \"I need to be in the game more\". Sometimes Farrell is trying to plan what England do and plot them around the pitch. George Ford needs to be doing that.\nHenry Slade is your dream but he is injured. He would have been the answer without a question of a doubt. At the moment they are having to do what they can with limited resources.\nEngland edged the breakdown in terms of numbers and in terms of actual turnovers.\nThere are a lot of people in the England pack that can make turnovers with Dan Cole, Chris Robshaw, Joe Launchbury, James Haskell, Billy Vunipola and Mako Vunipola off the bench.\nI do hope England don't come up against an out-and-out specialist open-side flanker and get done again. We are not going to see that probably until we go to play Australia in the summer but it will be interesting to see what England do in the meantime.\nWe still need to develop an out-and-out number seven. It will strengthen our game but someone has got to play well enough to keep knocking on the door.\nI judge intensity on the speed of your ball coming out from rucks and how fast people are getting into position to carry again.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nEngland completely outworked Scotland in that respect. I also judge intensity on what a side does in defence - in terms of line speed in getting up to make a tackle.\nIn the first half England were a bit off it but in the second half they were outstanding. They really led the line and outworked Scotland. From that point of view I think Eddie will be very happy.\nThe scorelines might be similar between England's first game under Stuart Lancaster at Murrayfield in 2012 (a 13-6 victory) and this weekend but England had a lot more control this weekend.\nAt the same time it can't really be compared. Stuart was creating a brand new team. He got rid of all the old guys and brought in loads of youngsters. Jones' team knew each other very well.\nI would give it a solid six and a half out of 10. Maybe a seven. There is still a lot of work to be done but knowing Jones and the workaholic nature he has got, he'll think the same.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "In terms of what England wanted out of the game with Scotland I think they got everything.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Arguably, the appalling effects of that first atomic strike - and the subsequent attack on Nagasaki - have played a large part in the determination to prevent the use of far more devastating weapons developed since.\nBack then, the US was the only nation with \"the bomb\".\nThe story since has been of the steady spread, the proliferation, of nuclear weapons: first to Russia, Britain, France and China - then to Israel (although never officially acknowledged), India, Pakistan, North Korea.\nThe big powers seemed either unable or unwilling to prevent that spread except perhaps now - in the case of Iran.\nAll sorts of conflicting signals are coming out of the international talks in Vienna meant to end all the hostility between the major world powers and Iran over its much disputed nuclear programme. There's talk of both breakdown and possible breakthrough.\nSo why is it judged so important to stop Iran?\nI asked Sir John Sawers, chief British negotiator with Iran from 2003 to 2007, and after that the UK's representative on the UN Security Council when sanctions against Iran were being decided.\nHe said: \"If Iran acquired a nuclear weapon, then it would change the dynamic across the Middle East.\n\"It would make them invulnerable to any response to their unacceptable behaviour in the region.\"\nSir John told me: \"If there is an agreement then, first of all, it gives everyone much greater assurance that Iran is not going to make a break for nuclear weapons.\n\"It opens the possibility of Iran and its Arab neighbours coming together and developing a more normal relationship.\n\"At the moment, the Middle East is riven by disputes - many of them along Sunni-Shia lines - and if we can create a possibility whereby Saudis and Iranians can talk to one another and it is not driven by continuous hostility, then there is a possibility of creating a different sort of Middle East.\"\nIt's not just August 1945 which hangs heavy over the negotiations with Iran.\nThe events of February 1979 in Iran itself, and everything which has followed, help explain the years of suspicion and outright hostility between Tehran and Washington which a nuclear deal could do so much to ease.\nAyatollah Khomeini's triumphant return to Tehran - on 1 February 1979 - from exile in Paris to take power as supreme leader of an Islamic Republic symbolises the moment when the US and its allies lost control of Iran with the fall of the shah.\nThe years of blatant Western interference were over.\nRuhollah Khomeini was born in Kohmeyn in central Iran. He became a religious scholar and in the early 1920s rose to become an 'ayatollah', a term for a leading Shia scholar.\nArrested in 1962 by the shah's security service for his outspoken opposition to the pro-Western regime of the Shah. His arrest elevated him to the status of national hero.\nExiled in 1964, living in Turkey, Iraq and then France, from where he urged his supporters to overthrow the shah.\nIn January 1979, the shah's government collapsed and he and his family fled into exile. On 1 February, Khomeini returned to Iran in triumph.\nThere was a national referendum and Khomeini won a landslide victory. He declared an Islamic republic and was appointed Iran's political and religious leader for life.\nIslamic law was introduced across the country.\nThe new religious leadership inherited a nuclear research programme, but consistently denies expanding it with the aim of making \"the bomb\".\nThe big powers have never accepted that, pointing instead to all the Iranian effort to produce highly-enriched uranium in the quantities you could only need to build a bomb, as well as the secrecy and alleged concealment of so much activity which is specifically outlawed by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to which Iran is a signatory.\nYears of pressure applied by sanctions and negotiations to find a way forward have now reached a point where agreement could - just could - be possible.\nI spoke to Ariane Tabatabai, of Georgetown University, who, like me, has been in Vienna to follow what is supposed to be the endgame in these talks.\nShe told me: \"Ultimately, the negotiations are about making sure that Iran's nuclear programme remains peaceful and to do that it needs to provide a set of assurances and that would mean Iran scaling back some of its nuclear activities.\n\"It will also provide more transparency to the International Atomic Energy Agency to make sure that everything is essentially under constant monitoring, with enhanced access given to its facilities so the international community can verify that Iran is holding its end of the bargain.\"\nWhich brings us neatly to the unanswerable question: Is the Iranian leadership ready to make a bargain?\nIt could be, partly to pacify those Iranians fed up with sanctions which help cripple their economy and symbolise isolation from a fast-developing world they yearn to be part of.\nProfessor Ali Ansari, historian of Iran at St Andrews University, pointed me to another of the country's ambitions, which is to recover some of the global respect which Iran believes it is due.\n\"What the Iranians are after is a degree of respect as a country that considers itself a great power - certainly in the region - that has not had a good time in the last century or so.\n\"The real pride and achievement is that they have developed what they've considered to be an indigenous nuclear industry.\n\"One of the arguments many people have made is that an Islamic government wouldn't be scientifically advanced.\n\"Well for the Iranians, you know, this is, sort of proof that it actually can be, if they put their mind to it.\"\nBut Prof Ansari is far from certain that a deal can be done, and - even if it is - that it will hold.\nAnd Sir John, from all his years negotiating with Iran, is blunt: \"Whenever you buy a carpet in Iran, you have to buy it two, three times over.\n\"You sometimes feel that is the same in the nuclear negotiations as well. There is an Iranian saying that the real negotiation only begins once the agreement is signed.\n\"They will always come back for more. Even if we get an agreement - it doesn't mean it is 'peace in our time'.\"\nSo suspicion on both sides remains strong.\nWhatever happens in the next few days, building and then maintaining trust between Iran and the key world powers, particularly the US, is still the toughest of all the challenges.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "We're fast approaching the 70th anniversary next month of the dropping of the first nuclear bomb, on Hiroshima.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Next week the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is due in the Burmese capital Nay Pyi Taw and in September Ms Suu Kyi will head to the United States for the UN General Assembly and talks with President Obama.\nThe Nobel laureate was no doubt bracing herself for awkward questions about why she wasn't doing more to help Myanmar's Muslim minority and in particular the 800,000 or so Rohingya. Those questions can now be easily deflected with reference to this new commission.\nBut there's more at play than that. By setting up the commission, Ms Suu Kyi is signalling that she is open to new ideas, and doesn't have all the answers.\nKofi Annan may be 78 but, as you'd expect from a former UN secretary general, he's his own man.\nThe final report, due to be delivered by the end of August 2017, is likely to contain suggestions that many Burmese consider unpalatable.\nAlmost certainly it will insist that the Rohingya's basic human rights are respected, perhaps recommending that Myanmar offer them a better route to citizenship.\nIn Myanmar's current political climate it's hard for Ms Suu Kyi to bring those ideas to the table. She'd be attacked not just by hardline Buddhists but many within her own party.\nSo Kofi Annan and his report could be the \"Trojan Horse\" that brings this sort of proposal into the national debate.\nThere are of course plenty of caveats.\nProblems as deeply entrenched as those between the Buddhist and Muslim communities in Rakhine State will not be solved overnight. The animosity between them has built up over decades with many in the Buddhist majority seeing the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from across the border in Bangladesh.\nAfter the violence of 2012, more than 100,000 Rohingya were forced from their homes into camps. In the years that have followed there's been no real effort to help them return.\nRakhine has become increasingly segregated, with some comparing it to South Africa's apartheid. Things have become quieter but there's been little reconciliation.\nWhatever the commission ends up concluding, any move to give the Rohingya greater rights will be hugely controversial not just in Rakhine State but across the country.\nVocal parts of the Buddhist community are openly hostile towards international aid agencies and the UN. They're unlikely to welcome Kofi Annan's team, no doubt anticipating the sort of recommendations he might make.\nImplementing any \"solution\" will be even harder.\nBut the formation of this advisory commission is something new. However small, it's the first bit of positive news that the Rohingya have had for a long time.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "There haven't been many good moments for Myanmar's Rohingya Muslims in the last four years.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

I don't think there was any hugging when I won Wimbledon.\nSo it was with a straight handshake that we greeted each other at Queen's Club on Tuesday morning -  the first time we'd seen each other since the US Open last September.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nWe'd chatted occasionally over the past couple of years and I'd spoken to him a few times at the end of last year.\nI was just staying in contact, seeing what he was up to, and I knew he'd done some trials with other players so was interested to know if he was considering getting back on the tour.\nWe know each other very well and it was good to have him back on Tuesday, it didn't feel strange at all. Getting a win over someone as good on grass as Nicolas Mahut was certainly a great start.\nIvan is very clear and has strong opinions on things.\nThat's important, I like that. I'd rather someone was very strong with what they're saying and, if I disagree, that's not a problem for him. He doesn't take it to heart.\nIt's a bit easier to communicate when you don't feel like you're going to upset someone.\nI also enjoy his company and his sense of humour. He'll chat about pretty much anything. He's into his sports and has lots of good stories from when he was on tour.\nIt was a bit different back then with Johnny Mac [McEnroe] and Jimmy Connors around. There weren't microphones and cameras everywhere. I'd say it was little bit more interesting in some ways.\nObviously there are rivalries on the tour now but, from the stories that I've heard, I'd say the players today are a lot more friendly with each other off the court.\nIt's important that Ivan and my other coach, Jamie Delgado, spend time together over the next few days.\nIvan has arrived with his own clear ideas on what he thinks I need to be doing but one of his great strengths is he's a very good team player. It's crucial that he and Jamie see eye to eye.\nUltimately I spend 40 weeks of the year with Jamie, and he also needs to believe and buy into the stuff that I'm working on as well.\nJamie knows me well too, he's spent pretty much every day with me for the last three or four months, and that can help Ivan.\nSo the two of them will chat about the things we need to concentrate on, especially this week on the grass. I'll be told before practice that this is what we're doing, I'll give a bit of feedback about what I might want to focus on, and we'll start work.\nI'm the number two player in the world by a decent distance in terms of ranking points, so I'm not playing badly, but the goals remain the same as ever.\nThere are still things I feel I can improve upon, which I need to do if I want to get to number one in the world and try and win majors.\nI believe that Ivan, along with the other guys I'm working with, can help me achieve that.\nI think my team is very strong right now. I've been getting better over the past few months, I've improved some things, and hopefully I can get a few percent better over the next few months.\nWinning a fifth title at Queen's Club this week would be the perfect start.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nAndy Murray was talking to BBC Sport's Piers Newbery.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Ivan Lendl is definitely more of a handshake than a hug kind of guy.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

And at this late stage of the year, it will be no easy task.\nSo who will be on Wolff's shortlist and how likely are they to get the seat?\nThis is the fight many would like to see. Hamilton and Alonso are regarded as the two towering talents of their generation and their intense battle as McLaren team-mates in 2007 was cut short by Alonso falling out with boss Ron Dennis and leaving the team. They ended that year tied on points, one behind world champion Kimi Raikkonen, with four wins each.\nRound two would be the biggest box office F1 could hope for, but it is highly unlikely to happen for two reasons: 1) Alonso is under contract to McLaren and even if he has a break clause - which they say he does not - they would not want to let him go; 2) More importantly, Wolff knows that the problems he had with Hamilton and Rosberg would pale compared to the potential difficulties of handling Hamilton and Alonso.\nChances of it happening: 6/10\nThe Australian was the choice of many observers as the driver of 2016, and Wolff is a big fan. The on-track battle with Hamilton would be intense, but Ricciardo is a laid-back character and would probably be easier to handle off it.\nBut he is under contract to Red Bull until 2018. Red Bull says they have no intention of letting him go, but if Wolff approached them there is just the possibility that they may consider selling Ricciardo. Why? Because most accept that, long term, Ricciardo and Max Verstappen is not a sustainable line-up - if Red Bull become title contenders their relationship is very likely to become incendiary.\nChances: 6/10\nVerstappen is the big rising star of F1. Shaded by Ricciardo over 2016 as a whole, performances such as his stunning drive in the wet in Brazil last month mark him out as a future world champion.\nWolff would be very interested but, like Ricciardo, Verstappen is under contract to Red Bull - in his case to the end of 2019. And Red Bull are even more in love with the Dutchman than they are with Ricciardo.\nChances: 4/10\nVettel's love affair with Ferrari - and vice versa - is long over after a difficult and disappointing season. Relations with team boss Maurizio Arrivabene are frayed - especially since the Italian said the four-time champion should focus more on his driving and needed to \"earn\" a new contract beyond 2017. And Vettel was unhappy with the decision to split with technical director James Allison in the summer.\nLikewise, Ferrari have been confused how, after a year and a half of easily beating team-mate Kimi Raikkonen, Vettel's form slipped in the second half of 2016 - although they might want to read the previous paragraph for an answer.\nVettel has been shopping around for a move and would almost certainly welcome a switch to Mercedes. But there are some problems: 1) his contract runs to the end of 2017 and there is no obvious replacement for Ferrari; 2) he might not fancy going up against Hamilton; 3) Vettel and Hamilton together is almost as much of a recipe for trouble as Hamilton and Alonso.\nChances of it happening: 8/10\nWolff has a long relationship with Bottas as part of his management team and rates him highly. The Finn has impressed in the last four seasons with Williams and would be a low-maintenance choice. He would deliver solid results on track and is calm and would not rock the boat off it.\nNext year is the last year of his contract at Williams. The team is not the most flush with cash in the pit lane and Wolff would almost certainly be able to put together an attractive deal - either for a cash payment to release Bottas or a reduction in Williams' engine fee.\nBut Williams have an 18-year-old rookie in the well-resourced Canadian Lance Stroll in their other car next year and need experience in the lead car. Wolff could offer them Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein, who raced for Manor in 2016, in exchange. But would Williams accept? Felipe Nasr, who raced for Sauber in 2016, would also be an option for them, and please F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone, who needs a Brazilian in the sport to satisfy its largest single TV audience.\nChances: 9/10\nThe German is the obvious choice - he is Mercedes' reserve driver, he has tested for the team several times, and he is a free agent. But he has only one season's race experience, and although he has put in some promising drives, he has had a few shaky ones as well.\nPutting him in a race-winning car with Hamilton as his team-mate would be a big ask. And that's without even considering his personality. Insiders say Wehrlein can be difficult and self-centred, and Wolff will be wary of putting such a character alongside Hamilton.\nChances: 8/10\nAnother Mercedes young driver, Ocon has impressed in his half-season alongside Wehrlein at Manor - so much so that Force India picked him rather than the German as their second driver alongside Sergio Perez for 2017.\nBut Ocon has only nine races under his belt and it's surely too early for him to get a seat at the factory Mercedes team.\nChances: 7/10\nA left-field choice, the Scot has been out of F1 for two years now. But he was Williams reserve driver this year and is a Mercedes-contracted driver in the DTM German Touring Car Championship and would be a solid option.\nChances: 5/10\nButton has retired from F1, but remains contracted to McLaren. He made it very clear in the last few weeks that he needed a break from the sport.\nChances: 1/10\nThe German has just signed a three-year deal with Renault, but the French company and Mercedes have links on a corporate level and Wolff is close friends with their racing boss Frederic Vasseur.\nBut taking Hulkenberg would leave Renault with a vacancy that would be tough to fill and Wolff is not overly enamoured with him either.\nChances: 2/10\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Mercedes Formula 1 boss Toto Wolff admits that Nico Rosberg's decision to retire took him completely by surprise - but it is only the start of his problems.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

It would apply to those with less than six months to live.\nTwo doctors would have to independently confirm the patient was terminally ill and had reached their own, informed decision to die.\nSome 110 peers are already listed to speak when the House of Lords debates the private members bill on Friday.\nInsisting it would not be \"anti-Christian\" to change the law, Lord Carey said the current situation risked \"undermining the principle of human concern which should lie at the heart of our society\".\nHe added: \"Today we face a central paradox. In strictly observing the sanctity of life, the Church could now actually be promoting anguish and pain, the very opposite of a Christian message of hope.\"\nWhen Lord Carey was still the Archbishop of Canterbury he was among the opponents of Lord Joffe's Assisting Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill, which was successfully blocked in the House of Lords in 2006.\nBut in his article in Saturday's Daily Mail Lord Carey said: \"The fact is that I have changed my mind. The old philosophical certainties have collapsed in the face of the reality of needless suffering.\"\nHe said it was the case of Tony Nicklinson, who had locked-in syndrome and died after being refused the legal right to die , who had had the \"deepest influence\" on his decision.\nMr Nicklinson's widow Jane, said Lord Carey's switch was \"huge\".\n\"I'm amazed actually and thrilled because the Church has always been one of our greatest opponents,\" she told BBC Radio 5 live.\n\"Someone shouldn't be forced to stay alive with daily suffering - his life was a living hell.\"\nThere's been something of a shocked reaction to what Lord Carey said. Let's remember he's a former archbishop. He still has some influence in the Church, especially among the more traditionalist minded Anglicans.\nSo what he said really will have some consequences. He'll also have some influence presumably in the House of Lords, having argued in the past strongly against similar legislation.\nOne of the most telling things about what Lord Carey has said is that he now thinks it's not \"un-Christian\" to allow people to take their own lives when they're suffering at the end of their lives.\nIt speaks to a body of people, including in the Anglican church, who now feel they can to some extent re-interpret what it is to be Christian, to be Anglican and how to put that into practice in their everyday lives.\nTo hear that coming from a stalwart defender of biblical truth like Lord Carey is pretty significant.\nLord Falconer told BBC Radio 5 live that Lord Carey \"makes the point that it's not anti-Christian to support the change in the law that my bill proposes\".\n\"I believe it reflects the view of almost everyone in the debate that - whatever view you take about the issues - nobody wants people who are properly motivated by compassion to be prosecuted. And he puts those arguments incredibly powerfully.\"\nHowever, the current Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby warned Lord Falconer's bill would mean elderly and disabled people coming under pressure to end their lives.\n\"What sort of society would we be creating if we were to allow this sword of Damocles to hang over the head of every vulnerable, terminally-ill person in the country?\" he wrote in the Times.\n\"It would be very naive to think that many of the elderly people who are abused and neglected each year, as well as many severely disabled individuals, would not be put under pressure to end their lives if assisted suicide were permitted by law.\n\"It would be equally naive to believe, as the Assisted Dying Bill suggests, that such pressure could be recognised in every instance by doctors given the task of assessing requests for assisted suicide.\n\"Abuse, coercion and intimidation can be slow instruments in the hands of the unscrupulous, creating pressure on vulnerable people who are encouraged to 'do the decent thing'.\"\nThe 1961 Suicide Act makes it an offence to encourage or assist a suicide or a suicide attempt in England and Wales. Anyone doing so could face up to 14 years in prison.\nThe law is almost identical in Northern Ireland. There is no specific law on assisted suicide in Scotland, creating some uncertainty, although in theory someone could be prosecuted under homicide legislation.\nThere have already been several attempts to legalise assisted dying, but these have been rejected.\nThe Commission on Assisted Dying, established and funded by campaigners who have been calling for a change in the law, concluded in 2012 that there was a \"strong case\" for allowing assisted suicide for people who are terminally ill in England and Wales.\nBut the medical profession and disability rights groups, among others, argue that the law should not be changed because it is there to protect the vulnerable in society.\nIn other countries, such as Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, legislation has been introduced to allow assisted dying. France is considering a possible introduction of similar legislation, although there is opposition from its medical ethics council.\nCampaign group Dignity in Dying predicts that a lot more countries will follow suit.\nThe Bishop of Carlisle, the Right Reverend James Newcome, said Lord Carey's comments would not influence any vote by bishops in the House of Lords.\n\"The general synod has debated it and come to a conclusion. That's the position to which we're sticking.\"\nBut Lord Carey did received support from Rabbi Jonathan Romain, an inter-faith leader for campaign group Dignity in Dying.\nHe said the experience in the US state of Oregon - where assisted dying became legal in 1997 - showed \"very few people\" would use the right to get help to end their lives.\nThe Church of England said in a statement that its governing body, the General Synod, had passed a motion on the issue in February 2012.\nThe motion reaffirmed the Church's \"support for the current law on assisted suicide as a means of contributing to a just and compassionate society in which vulnerable people are protected\".\nAnd Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin, who is the Speaker's chaplain in the House of Commons, said having an assisted suicide law would sanitise death.\n\"I just happen to believe that matters of life and death in that way is not for us to play with. There are lots and lots of vulnerable people out there... you cannot make a law that is going to have a serious impact on a majority of people.\"\nDr Peter Saunders, chief executive of the Christian Medical Fellowship said he was concerned about vulnerable people being exploited.\n\"We've got to think about the people who are going to feel a duty to end their lives so as not to be a burden to others.\n\"I'm worried about the disabled people, the depressed and elderly, who are going to be put at danger by this bill which really just has eligibility criteria and not safeguards.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey says he will support legislation that would make it legal for terminally ill people in England and Wales to receive help to end their lives.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

It's inexplicable to a lot football fans who love the game.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4, the 56-year-old added: \"I suppose you can explain it in terms of a panic decision and for me a wrong decision.\n\"I shed a tear last night for Claudio, for football and for my club.\"\nAfter news of the 65-year-old Italian's dismissal broke on Thursday, former England captain Lineker, who played for his hometown club for seven seasons, said the \"game's gone\" in a post on social media.\n\"It's a sign of modern football, what happened last season was truly extraordinary, \" he added on Friday. \"The lack of gratitude from the owners of the club and who knows who else involved in such a decision beggars belief.\n\"That season will remain with us forever, it was truly special and a lot of that was down to the management.\n\"The same guy cannot be considered incapable of doing the job a few months months later after achieving what, for me, was the biggest miracle in sport.\"\nChelsea dismissed Jose Mourinho as manager the season after their 2015 title and Lineker says while that is \"expected at big clubs\", the decision to sack Ranieri \"takes away from the glory\" for the Foxes.\n\"For a club like Leicester to win the league last season, the magnificence of the story, the likeability of the club under Ranieri - the ultimate gentleman - it kind of demeans the club.\n\"Leicester were hugely popular right around the world. To do something like this now loses a lot of that popularity.\"\nFrance midfielder N'Golo Kante moved to Chelsea for \u00a330m in the summer and Lineker said losing the 25-year-old was \"huge\".\nHe added: \"There were a whole host of things that made the season fairly inevitable in the sense it would never be anything like last season.\n\"They had a journeyman back four that was protected brilliantly by Kante. They were an ageing back four, who are a year older.\n\"All of a sudden they were on pre-season tours, playing Barcelona, travelling all over the world. They were not prepared for the new season and then the confidence aspect sneaks in.\"\nFormer Leicester and England goalkeeper Peter Shilton, said the club's struggles this season made Ranieri's sacking understandable.\nSpeaking to Radio 4, he said: \"Going down would be a disaster for Leicester and I suppose the board have made a very brave decision.\n\"If they stay in the Premier League then they've made the right decision. A lot of people will say there's no sentiment in football, look at what he's done for the club, but he's had a lot of the season to get things going.\n\"There's obviously some reason why not. We're not privy to that - maybe the board are. Maybe there's unrest in the dressing room, who knows? Maybe the players just aren't performing.\"\nLeicester owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha used social media platform Instagram to explain why he sacked Ranieri.\n\"We have done our best as management, we do not have only one problem to solve, but there are a million things to do to make our club survive, \" the billionaire wrote.\n\"Please respect my decision, I will never let the club down\".\nThis content will not work on your device, please check Javascript and cookies are enabled or update your browser\nJason Bourne, BBC Radio Leicester\n\"There's almost a sense of grief in the city today, with many having lost their 'favourite uncle'.\n\"Claudio Ranieri was the man that brought the dream to life by winning the Premier League title. It has gone sour this term with players underperforming, new signings not working out and baffling tactics at time from the Tinkerman.\n\"I thought they would get relegated with Ranieri in charge. I hated to say it. I hoped it wouldn't come true and I'd be proved wrong.\n\"This gives them a chance. A different kind of chance to stay up.\"\nPhil McNulty, BBC chief football writer:\nIt is almost the thought that dare not speak its name amid the wave of shock, outrage and disgust at Leicester's decision to ruthlessly dismiss the hugely popular 65-year-old, who won the hearts of all supporters with his good humour, class and dignity as he led the Foxes to the title.\nBut is there actually method in what many see as the madness of the club's Thai owners?\nLeicester's fall has been more dramatic than anything they could have foreseen in their worst nightmares. A win for any of Sunderland, Crystal Palace and Hull City this weekend would put the Foxes in the relegation places. Wins for all three and they would be bottom by the time they face Liverpool on what will now be a highly charged occasion at the King Power on Monday.\nAfter 26 games last year they were top on 53 points, two ahead of Spurs. This season they are 17th after 25 games, with only 21 points. Last season they had lost only three games compared with 14 in this campaign, and conceded only 29 goals compared with 43 this term. Indeed, they only conceded 36 in the entire 2015-16 season.\nThe difference is stark and, very clearly in the opinion of Leicester's owners, dangerous.\nPat Murphy, BBC Radio 5 live\nI understand some influential players in the dressing room, who were part of the Nigel Pearson squad a couple of years ago, were making graphic contrasts with team spirit and the organisational qualities of Pearson compared with Ranieri this season.\nThe club never really lost faith in Pearson this time two years ago. Despite the fact they were in the parlous position, the general feeling was that he had the dressing room and knew where he was going. He left in the summer of 2015 for different reasons - personal reasons associated with his son, who was on the staff.\nQuite clearly, Ranieri had lost a lot of key allies in that Leicester dressing room with long memories.\nOn 7 February, Leicester issued a statement saying Ranieri had their \"unwavering support\". Sixteen days later they sacked the 65-year-old Italian, who had signed a new four-year deal in the summer.\nHis departure came a day after the Foxes won praise for their performance despite losing 2-1 in their Champions League last-16 first-leg tie at Sevilla.\n\"Ranieri was told he was sacked on Thursday afternoon in Leicester once the team returned from Spain, but the suggestion is the owners decided before that defeat by Sevilla,\" said BBC sports editor Dan Roan.\n\"The decision was taken very reluctantly but the club's owners are desperate to avoid relegation and its consequences.\"\nFoxes vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha said: \"This has been the most difficult decision we have had to make in nearly seven years since King Power took ownership of Leicester City.\n\"But we are duty-bound to put the club's long-term interests above all sense of personal sentiment, no matter how strong that might be.\n\"Claudio has brought outstanding qualities to his office. His skilful management, powers of motivation and measured approach have been reflective of the rich experience we always knew he would bring to Leicester City.\"\nSrivaddhanaprabha added: \"His warmth, charm and charisma have helped transform perceptions of the club and develop its profile on a global scale. We will forever be grateful to him for what he has helped us to achieve.\n\"It was never our expectation that the extraordinary feats of last season should be replicated this season. Indeed, survival in the Premier League was our first and only target at the start of the campaign.\n\"But we are now faced with a fight to reach that objective and feel a change is necessary to maximise the opportunity presented by the final 13 games.\"\nA news conference with Leicester assistant manager Craig Shakespeare will take place at 13:00 GMT on Friday.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThis content will not work on your device, please check Javascript and cookies are enabled or update your browser\n14 February 2016: Leicester lose 2-1 at Arsenal, their final defeat of the 2015-16 season before a 12-game unbeaten run.\n2 May 2016: The Foxes are crowned champions of England for the first time in their history as Tottenham draw at Chelsea.\n16 July 2016: Midfielder N'Golo Kante leaves to sign a five-year deal with Chelsea.\n13 August 2016: Leicester lose their first game of the 2016-17 season - a 2-1 defeat at Hull City.\n15 October 2016: The Foxes are hammered 3-0 by table-topping Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.\n22 November 2016: Leicester secure top spot in their Champions League group with one game to spare.\n18 December 2016: Ranieri is named Coach of the Year at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards.\n7 February 2017: After a run of two wins in 15 league games, Leicester give Ranieri their \"unwavering support\".\n22 February 2017: The Foxes lose 2-1 to Sevilla in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie.\n23 February 2017: Ranieri is sacked.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Leicester's decision to sack Claudio Ranieri nine months after winning the Premier League made former Foxes striker Gary Lineker \"shed a tear\".", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Not over-worked, but Celtic had a number of other chances. Not the worst.\nIn second-half, he came more to life in terms of getting forward, which is a big part of his game.\nIn team for his height and domination but didn't dominate his opponent or take responsibility for closing gap between defence and midfield. Use of the ball was poor.\nProbably his poorest performance for Aberdeen - uncertain, played too deep. He didn't close down James Forrest quickly enough for the second goal and conceded the penalty for the third. Must be disappointed, because he's looked good since coming to the club\nWasn't exposed on too many occasions against Patrick Roberts. Did have the chance with a header and maybe should have done better with it. Moved to centre-back later, his preferred his position. Didn't play to the standard he's capable of.\nNot the worst in midfield. Tried hard but played in an area that was dominated by Celtic. Only got close to Celtic's midfielders on a couple of occasions and should have made it more difficult for them.\nAn opportunity as captain to lift the trophy. He normally gives you an element of control in midfield but didn't do that. The gap between him and his defence was too wide, allowing Roberts, Rogic and Forrest to get in behind.\nLargely anonymous in the first-half. Spent his time worrying about defensive duties rather than what he's good at. Turned it around in second half and had a number of good runs, but he's a match winner and he didn't show what he was capable of.\nCeltic dominated in midfield and McLean must take responsibility. He's been at the club long enough to know what's expected, should be performing to a high level and on the big stage. If you want to be an international, you have to perform better.\nWhenever he got on the ball, you felt, if anything was going to happen creatively, it was going to come through him. He was taken out the game on two or three occasions and Celtic players realised he was the main threat.\nNot the Adam Rooney I know. Didn't do much in terms of causing a threat to the two centre-backs, who handled him extremely well. He needed to work harder to make it difficult for them but had little support. Should be a goal threat but didn't do that.\nWon a couple of headers, but his timing was out at times after coming on for O'Connor.\nExpect more from a player like him. With Hayes, who he replaced, he's the quality in terms of creativity and didn't create anything.\nBarely touched the ball after taking over from Rooney. Hard when coming on at 3-0 down.\nHad that save from Andrew Considine's first-half header but didn't have much else to do. To force his way back into the side and win a medal, you have to give him great credit.\nFairly comfortable at right-back, as steady as always, and was in control defensively.\nWas probably the pick of the back four. Stepping out, he made the opening goal. Passed the ball well throughout.\nStrong, powerful figure at the back. Was never put under significant pressure.\nAttacked the by-line as always and delivered an early cross for Moussa Dembele to head on target.\nMan of the match, dominated proceedings, looked in control and showed flair at times. Won a tackle with O'Connor that probably put paid to the defender for the next five or 10 minutes. Led by example.\nSolid display, worked very hard, not over-spectacular and should have scored at the end after getting himself into a great position.\nAlways capable of doing something in the game. An attacking threat throughout. He plays the position well and scored the opening goal.\nScored Celtic's second goal, laid on a couple, won the penalty for the third. I asked the question before, could he step up? And I think he did.\nProbably Celtic's quietest player. Wasn't involved as much as he would have wanted to be.\nProbably the quietest we've seen him but still scored his goal. Not as sharp as he normally is but led the line well.\nDid what he had do after coming on for Roberts. Kept it nice and solid in midfield.\nAnother who did his job well and kept the performance ticking over after coming on for Rogic.\nDidn't have much time to impress as a late sub for Forrest but didn't do anything wrong.\nPat Bonner and Willie Miller were talking to BBC Scotland's Richard Wilson.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Celtic cruised to a 3-0 win over Aberdeen at Hampden Park as Brendan Rodgers secured his first trophy as the Scottish Premiership leaders' manager.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

He was smiling in what she recalls was a sad way. She said she would be back tomorrow.\n\"He suddenly just said 'I love you so much',\" she remembers.\n\"I said 'Yes, of course. I love you too'.\"\nBut when she got home, she received a call from the hospital telling her to rush back in. She did not get the chance to speak to him again.\nAs he lay dying in his hospital bed, Alexander Litvinenko had remained the trained operative he had always been and tried to recall for police every detail that might hold a clue to his poisoning.\nFor the police, he was something unique - a living murder victim - a man who was going to die but had time to talk to them.\nSo who did he hold responsible for the mysterious illness which was taking such a terrible toll on his body? \"Everything that happened to him and he was able to speak - able to sign - he said Putin was responsible for his death,\" his widow told the BBC.\nThe public inquiry will examine the central question - who was responsible for what was described by a lawyer in a previous hearing as 'an act of state sponsored nuclear terrorism on the streets of London'?\nIt was one of the most remarkable and sensitive murder cases in modern times.\n\"This inquiry was different from any other investigation that I've ever been involved in,\" says Peter Clarke, who at the time ran the Metropolitan Police Counter-Terrorism Command which handled the investigation.\n\"It was not only a murder inquiry but there were other key areas that we had to think about: public safety - over 40 sites of radioactive contamination in public places, on public transport, aircraft, offices, restaurants... And then there are the international dimensions, the diplomatic dimensions and the intelligence areas that came into this inquiry.\"\nMuch is already known about the broad brush of events - that Alexander Litvinenko was killed by radioactive Polonium 210 and that two Russians, Alexander Lugovoi and Dimitri Kovtun, are believed by police to be responsible.\nThey are believed to have administered the substance in a cup of tea at the Millennium Hotel's Pine Bar  in central London.  Both men, though, have denied any involvement.\nThis inquiry may reveal new details of the trail of evidence, though - a radioactive trail which shows that the Pine Bar may have been the third attempt to kill Litvinenko.\nBut one issue never publicly examined is that of motivation. Why was Litvinenko killed? And crucially - was it on the orders of the Russian state? That is one subject this inquiry will be looking at.\nLitvinenko was a former FSB officer who had become a fierce critic of Vladimir Putin, first in Russia and then in Britain where he eventually received citizenship.\nThe inquiry was formally created in July 2014 after the government finally relented in the face of pressure from Marina Litvinenko and Sir Robert Owen, a judge then sitting as coroner but now chairman of the inquiry.\nThe inquest process had hit a major problem - the government had demanded that certain material be kept secret but there is no provision for that in an inquest.\nSo both Marina Litvinenko and Sir Robert argued that the inquest should be converted into a public inquiry in which material can be considered in closed session. The government at first resisted but Marina Litvinenko persisted with legal challenges even as her money began to run out.\nIn July the government changed its stance. This was seen in some quarters as a reaction to worsening relations with Moscow.\nIn the past there was suspicion that there was a desire to put the Litvinenko case to bed and get back to business but by last summer the crisis over Ukraine had changed Britain's perspectives on Russia and may have led to the decision to hold an inquiry which could look at the issue of state responsibility.\nAt a pre-inquest hearing, lawyers for the inquiry said that the material in possession of the British government did establish a 'prima facie case' for the culpability of the Russian state in the death. But this may well be secret intelligence which will not come out in public evidence.\nOne thing the inquiry will be unlikely to look at in open session is Alexander Litvinenko's relationship with MI6.\nAt one hearing, a lawyer for the widow of Alexander Litvinenko said that her husband had carried out work for MI6 and had a dedicated handler or case-officer with the pseudonym of Martin.\nThis, the lawyer argued, meant that the inquest needed to look at whether the British state failed in its duty of care to Alexander Litvinenko by failing to take sufficient steps to protect him - in other words, could it have prevented the murder? In the end that issue was ruled out of the final inquiry.\nIt has been a long journey. I first interviewed Marina soon after her husband's murder when she showed a determination to uncover the truth.\nSpeaking to her eight years on, she remains as firm as ever in that pursuit and still has confidence in the ability of the British justice system to deliver final answers, despite all the ups and downs on the way.\nThe next few months will be the final test of that.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "For three weeks Alexander Litvinenko desperately tried to fight off the radiation that was destroying his body from within.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Buhari has himself to blame for unfortunately being a gentleman!\"\nOver in The Gambia, Yahya Jammeh is no gentleman - he's chosen to squat at State House.\nHe lost the presidential election to Adama Barrow and publicly conceded defeat.\nA little later, the thought of leaving the seat he has called his own for the last 22 years overpowered him and he changed his mind.\nAfrica and the world have asked him to go home, but he is defiant.\nAs his last day in office approaches on 19 of January, the same force he used to gain power in 1994 could be used to relieve him of his office.\nThere are three notable people who will be bowing out of office in 2017.\nEllen Johnson-Sirleaf, the first elected female head of state in Africa, is coming to the end of her second and final term of office in Liberia.\nOne of those waiting on the touchline to join the succession race is football star George Weah.\nThe former AC Milan and Chelsea striker failed to score in the 2005 presidential tournament but hopes 2017 will be his year.\nAngolans will have a chance to replace the only man they've known as president for nearly 40 years.\nAlthough Jose Eduardo dos Santos has announced he'll step down, his blood will still flow through the veins of power and the economy in Angola.\nHis daughter, Isabel, heads Sonangol, the state oil company and is considered by Forbes to be Africa's richest woman, while his son, Jose, is chairman of the country's sovereign wealth fund, Fundo Soberano de Angola.\nIn neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, 2017 could mark the beginning of the end for another family dynasty, which started in 1997 when Laurent Desire Kabila became president after overthrowing Mobutu Sese Seko.\nLaurent Kabila's son Joseph picked up the reigns after his father's assassination in 2001, and was bent on staying in power until attempts to change the constitution to allow him a third term backfired.\nViolent street protests have piled pressure on President Kabila to exit from office this year and the issue is bound to continue into the new year.\nThe theme of falling is alive in South Africa.\nThe #FeesMustFall campaign by university students sought to fight the rising cost of higher education and saw violent clashes between police and protesters, disruptions in the university calendar and the arrest of a number of students.\n2017 promises more of the same because not only have the fees not fallen, some top universities have announced an 8% increase.\nAnd then there's the question of the country's President Jacob Zuma.\nIn December 2017, his tenure as leader of the governing ANC party runs out, but his term as the country's president only ends in 2019.\nAllowing Mr Zuma to continue as head of state but with the ANC under someone else's leadership could create two centres of power, which could be political suicide.\nSo will the ANC #LetZumaFall as it did President Thabo Mbeki under similar circumstances?\n2017 will have answers.\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) is another that could face the threat of falling in Africa if more African countries continue to withdraw from the Rome Statute.\nA number of countries have notified the UN Secretary-General of their intention to withdraw, saying the ICC unfairly targets African leaders in its application of international justice.\nAnd now to international trends where fashion, like history, has a habit of repeating itself.\nA quick glance at catwalk signs for 2017 shows that the hems of women's skirts will be falling - to just below the knee.\nApparently midi-skirts elongate the figure and flatter the wearer, so this must be a good fall.\nThe Africa Cup of Nations tournament kicks off in mid-January in Gabon and Uganda carries the hopes of East Africa.\nThe region has a terrible record in continental football.\nUganda's last appearance in the finals was in 1978 when it lost to Ghana in the final.\nKenya and Tanzania have never progressed beyond the group stage, so if Uganda can rise, East Africa can stand tall.\nIn politics, despite all manner of socio-economic challenges, the spirit of the Africans is on the rise - they've already just about removed one long-serving president from power (The Gambia, even if he is still resisting ) and in 2017 a couple more might follow (DR Congo, Angola)\nWhen Africa stumbles, it must rise because as they say in Nigeria, the sun shines on those who stand before it shines on those who are sitting.\nMore from Joseph Warungu:\nShould the UK join the African Union?\nKenyans beg for mercy\nDoctors take on traditional healers\nWhy Kenya has banned on-air sex\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "In our series of letters from African journalists, media and communications trainer Joseph Warungu gives a personal guide to some of the key people, places and events to watch out for in Africa in 2017.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The original plan spared it but the new project runs over it instead.\nRio City Hall said it was in talks with the owner of a local football ground to provide a new pitch.\nThere were also concerns that those moving to the new social housing would lose the community feel they enjoyed in Vila Uniao.\n\"I grew up in the community with my parents and four brothers,\" Mr Soares said.\n\"There's a market, a bank, a school.

Ageing is a nuclear safety issue\".\nAs part of that ageing process the licensee was required to monitor and inspect the reactors regularly.\nSteve Thomas, professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, said: \"It doesn't feel good when we come up against limits and the first thing they [the ONR] do is to move the goalposts.\"\nMr Foy stressed that the ONR was a \"robust regulator\" and due process had been followed.\n\"If we feel the evidence they [EDF] have supplied is robust and sufficient to underpin the 8% case then we will agree it,\" he said.\nThe graphite bricks are integral to UK nuclear power stations and they act to moderate the nuclear reaction; it will not function without them.\nThe bricks cannot be replaced which means they are being carefully monitored as the reactors age. They become damaged through years of intense bombardment by radiation and effects of the coolant CO2 on the material.\nA distortion to the graphite core could prevent the control rods being inserted, which shut down the reactor in an emergency.\nEDF said \"safety of the public and our employees is our overriding priority\" and the company took a \"cautious approach\" working closely with the regulator and they operated with \"very conservative safety margins\" and safety requirements were \"stringent\".\nBut in shifting the graphite limit Dungeness can still run only until the start of 2020 but that is still three years fewer than EDF would like and it may have to request a second increase in the safety limit.\nProf Paul Mummery, from Manchester University, agreed that the original limits were \"conservative.\"\nBut he said the twin problems of graphite cracking and weight loss meant it may be \"uneconomic\" for EDF to keep all the 14 AGR reactors running in the long term because the regulator may insist on more inspections to demonstrate safety.\n\"They [EDF] are making good progress but I would not be able to say with absolute confidence that they will reach 2023,\" he said.\nIt was an \"engineering judgement\", he said, but \"no one could be sure\".\n\"There was more weight loss than expected in Dungeness B and that has led to some uncertainty about the continued operation.\"\nThe AGR reactors contribute about 15% of Britain's electricity, according to Prof Thomas.\nHe said EDF wanted the old AGR reactors to last until the planned next generation of nuclear power stations came on line after 2023 but said it was reaching a \"crunch point\".\nThe old reactors might not last as long as EDF would like and there were still real doubts about the plans to build the new reactor at Hinkley C in Somerset.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "A key safety limit at one of Britain's nuclear power stations is being raised to allow the life of the reactor to be extended, the BBC has learned.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Nothing! It's not fair, money can't buy what that lion gave to us, love. If Walter can't see that he should open his eyes and see what really is important in life - money or love?\nDaisy, Monmouthshire, Wales\nI believe that it is a cruel sport that shouldn't be done anywhere because the killing of animals will increase extinction. Even though the killing of animals is still done in certain countries I believe it is a cruel and unforgiving sport. From what has happened I believe that if anyone spends money to slay an animal they should still be arrested. In my opinion if anyone would want to pay to kill an animal I would consider them 'sick in the head'.\nEllie, Leeds, England\nI think it's wrong to hunt animals for sport because the hunter doesn't benefit from it and it's strange that someone gets a buzz from taking an animal's life. I know people that hunt deer but they do it for food and appreciate the fact that they've had to kill an animal to get the meat.\nJake, Essex, England\nIt's not right to kill animals or hunt them for sport as they have a conscience and mind.

The programme was started by the Labour government as a way to transform struggling schools.\nAfter the election the Education Secretary, Michael Gove, announced plans to allow all schools in England to convert to academy status. By September 2012 some 2,309 schools had converted, representing a growth of 1,307%, and 48% of secondary pupils were attending academies.\nAmyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office (NAO), said the increase was \"a significant achievement - however the Department for Education was not sufficiently prepared for the financial implications of such a rapid expansion, or for the challenge of overseeing and monitoring such a large number of new academies\".\nAccording to the report, the department had budgeted \u00a37.3bn to set up and run academies in the two years from April 2010 to March 2012.\nIt says officials were expecting some extra expenditure, to cover factors such as additional insurance, but were unprepared for the numbers of academies wanting to convert. In fact the total expenditure on academies amounted to \u00a38.3bn - \u00a31bn over budget.\nThe \u00a31bn includes \u00a3350m paid to local authorities for temporary continued funding of places at non-academy schools, effectively double funding places while academies were being set up.\nThe report says that to fund the expansion and remain within overall spending limits, the DfE had to find the money from other budgets, including the main schools settlement.\nA spokesman for the Department for Education said: \"We make no apology for the fact that more schools than even we imagined have opted to convert, and no apology for spending money on a programme that is proven to drive up standards and make long-term school improvements.\n\"We want as many schools as possible to take advantage of the significant benefits academy status brings because it means more schools run by great heads and teachers, not local authority or Whitehall bureaucrats, and more children getting a first-class education.\n\"The Department for Education has made significant savings in the last two and a half years and also set aside significant contingencies which have been set against the growth in academies.\n\"Additionally, the costs of converting academies have already fallen by 53% per academy. We anticipate further changes we are making will radically reduce costs in 2013-14 and beyond.\"\nMargaret Hodge MP, chairwoman of the Commons public accounts committee, said: \"The decision to change fundamentally the nature of the programme away from one solely directed at struggling schools is up to the government, but taxpayers have the right to expect a more considered and controlled approach to public spending than the department has so far displayed.\"\nShadow education secretary Stephen Twigg called for greater scrutiny, oversight and local accountability \"to ensure school standards improve and the taxpayer gets value for money\".\nThe figures also drew criticism from teaching unions with Mary Bousted, of the Association and Teachers and Lecturers, saying they showed \"only too clearly that the expansion of academies is being driven by political ideology and not by what's best for children's education\".\nChristine Blower, of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"It is absurd for the government to justify spending \u00a38.3bn on academy conversions in two years while at the same time warning of a dire economic situation. Meanwhile, many good state schools are told there's no money as they stand in a state of disrepair with ever-diminishing support services.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "A tenfold increase in the number of English schools converting to academies has meant \u00a31bn in extra costs, says the government's spending watchdog.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

That would push him right up the list for Ryder Cup qualification.

He seems philosophical - what will be, will be.\n\"It adds a little bit of pressure,\" he said. \"We're used to it, every week you've got pressure. I put a lot of pressure on myself every time I play so I don't really feel added pressure.\n\"I've been wanting to do this my whole life.

I'm not sure if you're ever really ready for it but you've just got to do your best and go for it.\"\nThere's a wider goal for Knox than doing well in his home country, or even achieving a dream Ryder Cup place.\nGetting into the top 20 or 30 players in the world is tremendously hard. Staying there is just as difficult, if not more challenging, and plenty of players have been there and fallen away.\n\"Of course the goal is to stay inside the top 50 but you have to play well to do that,\" said Knox.\n\"It's so hard to stay there. To be honest I don't know how I'm going to do. I could quite easily move forward or quite easily move back.\n\"That's the hard thing about golf. It's such a hard game.

They say endurance means a good wife but most women endure abusive relationship because they are not empowered economically, they depend on their husbands,\" she told the BBC about her decision.\nEight years later, Mrs Banda founded the National Association of Business Women, a group that lends start-up cash to small-scale traders - making her popular among Malawi's many rural poor.\nThat work also earned her international recognition - in 1997, she was awarded, along with former Mozambican President Joachim Chissano, the US-based Hunger Project's Africa Prize for Leadership for the Sustainable End of Hunger.\nShe also set up the Joyce Banda Foundation, a charity that assists Malawian children and orphans through education - she has a degree in early childhood education.\nJoyce Banda cut her teeth in politics in 1999 when she won a parliamentary seat on the ticket of the former ruling United Democratic Front.\nShe held a number of cabinet positions under former President Bakili Muluzi and Mr Mutharika during his first term.\nShe puts her achievements down to her happy marriage to retired Chief Justice Richard Banda with whom she has two children.\n\"My dear husband, Richard, has been the driving force behind my success and rise to whatever level I am now. My story and legacy is incomplete without his mention,\" she said.\nMrs Banda's presidential challenges are huge: Aside from handling political divisions and possible opposition from Mr Mutharika's allies, she has to address Malawi's serious economic difficulties.\nIt is one of the poorest countries in the world, with an estimated 75% of the population living on less than $1 (60p) a day.\nAnd former President Mutharika fell out with most of Western donors - on which the country depends for financial support.\nThe cutting off of direct aid resulted in the country's worst shortages of foreign currency, fuel and essential drugs.\nBut she has immediately made her mark - sacking Malawi's police chief Peter Mukhito, accused of mishandling anti-government riots last year in which at least 19 people were shot dead, and Patricia Kaliati as information minister.\nIn the wake of Mr Mutharika's death, Ms Kaliati had held a press conference saying Mrs Banda had no right to take over as president - despite what the constitution said.\nThe head of Malawi's state broadcaster has also been replaced.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Joyce Banda, who has made history becoming Malawi's first female president and only the second woman to lead a country in Africa, has a track record of fighting for women's rights.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The revenue generated does not go to the events themselves, the event organisers or to Edinburgh city council. \"This is money, which is going to the businesses of Edinburgh, be it retail, accommodation, food, drink, shopping and entertainment.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nEdinburgh's winter festivals generated more than \u00a3241m for the city, according to organisers.\n\n###\nArticle: The device, which the company is calling Spectacles, will go on sale later this year priced at $130 (\u00a3100).\nThe glasses will record up to 30 seconds of video at a time.\nAs part of the announcement, Snapchat is renaming itself Snap, Inc.\nThe renaming decision underlined the company\u2019s apparent ambition to go beyond the ephemeral messaging app, a product which is highly popular with young people.\nAn article published by the Wall Street Journal on Friday showed Snap\u2019s 26-year-old creator Evan Spiegel in a series of pictures taken by  fashion legend Karl Lagerfeld.\nIn an interview, Mr Spiegel explained his rationale for creating Spectacles.\n\"It was our first vacation, and we went to [Californian state park] Big Sur for a day or two. We were walking through the woods, stepping over logs, looking up at the beautiful trees.\n\"And when I got the footage back and watched it, I could see my own memory, through my own eyes - it was unbelievable.\n\"It\u2019s one thing to see images of an experience you had, but it\u2019s another thing to have an experience of the experience. It was the closest I\u2019d ever come to feeling like I was there again.\"\nOn Saturday, Snap released some limited information about how the glasses will work.\nFootage will be recorded in a new, circular format which can be viewed in any orientation, the company said. The battery on the device will last about a day.\nA light on the front of the device will indicate to people nearby when the glasses are recording.\nPrior to confirmation from Snap about the product, news website Business Insider published a promotional video it found on YouTube showing the product. The video has since been taken down.\nBroken Glass\nSpectacles will remind many of Google Glass, an ill-fated attempt by the search giant to create smart glasses.\nWhile Google Glass did get into the hands of developers around the world - at a cost of $1,500 each - the device never came close to being a consumer product. The company eventually halted development, but insisted the idea was not dead.\nThough Glass was beset by hardware issues, perhaps its main flaw was the public perception. At worst, many saw it as troubling, privacy-invading technology. At best, others just considered it ridiculous-looking.\nHowever, with a far lower price point, and likely adoption by influential celebrities, Snap\u2019s Spectacles stand a solid chance of being seen as cooler than Google\u2019s attempt.\n\"If you look at the kinds of glasses millennials wear, the design is very \u2018in\u2019,\" suggested Carolina Milanesi, a consumer technology analyst from Creative Strategies.\n\"Making them sunglasses helps hide the camera better, but it also limits the usage somewhat - you\u2019ll need to be outside in daylight.\nShe added: \"The name change is interesting as it would indicate a change in focus away from messaging, which with Spectacles makes sense. Snap is perhaps becoming more about life-logging, content generation and story-telling.\"\nAccording to the WSJ, Snap is not treating the device as a major hardware launch, rather a fun toy that will have limited distribution.\n\"We\u2019re going to take a slow approach to rolling them out,\u201d Mr Spiegel told the newspaper.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about us figuring out if it fits into people\u2019s lives and seeing how they like it.\"\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Messaging app firm Snapchat has announced its first gadget - sunglasses with a built-in camera.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Evidential Review Officer.\nOne of the EROs at the time was a black police officer.\nThe detective was concerned the use of the toy was racist and had not been investigated properly.\nHe raised the matter during a live internal website chat known as the \"Commissioner's Forum\", where staff are encouraged to discuss problems with the Met Commissioner, who at the time was Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe.\nThe detective received an online reply saying: \"What is described - if accurate - is unacceptable\" and was told that it would be looked into \"immediately\".\nBut a month later, the detective himself was put under investigation for allegedly posting \"untrue and potentially inflammatory comments\".\nHe was told his actions had \"breached the standards of professional behaviour... relating to \"honesty and integrity\" and \"discreditable conduct\", claims which, if proved, could have led to his dismissal\nEventually, in June 2015, after protracted internal disciplinary proceedings, the officer attended a gross misconduct hearing where it was ruled there was \"no case to answer\" and he was cleared.\nPaul Turpin, who was a representative for the Metropolitan Police Federation and supported the officer through the process, said: \"I was surprised when the matter was referred to a gross misconduct hearing and was not surprised when that hearing found the officer had no case to answer.\"\nHe suggested the allegation should never have got that far: \"Matters should be dealt with at the lowest appropriate level at the earliest possible opportunity.\"\nScotland Yard said there had been an \"internal review\" of the handling of the case after the hearing.\nIt said the original allegation about the monkey had been \"investigated locally and progressed as far as it could be\", though the inquiry was unable to establish who had placed the black toy animal in the police station.\nThe Asian detective, who has not been named by the BBC at his own request, began legal proceedings against the Met at an employment tribunal alleging he had been racially discriminated against and victimised.\nBut before a full hearing took place the force reached a settlement and agreed to pay damages.\nThe details of the agreement are confidential but the amount of compensation is thought to be in the region of \u00c2\u00a335,000.\nThe officer declined to comment and has not divulged any details of the agreement to the BBC.\nThe Met confirmed a settlement had been reached \"following judicial mediation\" at the Tribunal Services in March 2016.\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Richard Martin, who is in charge of professionalism at Scotland Yard, said the force had made \"significant investment\" in improving the way it handled staff complaints linked to discrimination, bullying or harassment and had introduced a new \"whistle-blowing\" policy.\n\"We have long recognised that people... fear being victimised if they raise a complaint, regardless of whether that fear is justified,\" he said.\n\"That has never been acceptable and we continue to make it very clear to our staff that victimisation will never be tolerated, that it will be investigated, and will have serious repercussions if it occurs\".\nBut Janet Hills, chairwoman of the Metropolitan Black Police Association, said the use of a black monkey toy and the treatment of the Asian police detective indicated there was still a long way to go.\n\"We're still trying to get rid of the dinosaurs in policing who are still protecting that culture\", she said, describing the \"monkey\" incident as \"unbelievable\" and \"unacceptable\".\n\"It's not just a toy, it's a toy to be used to say 'this is what I think of you',\" she said.\n\"It's racist and discriminatory behaviour,\" she said, adding that it went on because people thought they could \"get away with it\".\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "An Asian police officer who raised concerns about a \"racist\" toy monkey at work was accused of gross misconduct, BBC News has learned.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

He will be sworn in on 30 June.\nWhen asked about the high number of attacks on journalists, Mr Duterte said that \"you won't be killed if you don't do anything wrong\".\nCiting Jun Pala, a journalist, politician and critic of Duterte who was murdered in 2003, he said: \"I do not want to diminish his memory but he was a rotten son of a bitch. He deserved it.\"\n\"That can't be just freedom of speech. The constitution can no longer help you if you disrespect a person.\"\nThe National Union of Journalists of the Philippines said the comments were \"appalling\".\n\"Mr Duterte's crass pronouncement not only sullies the names and memories of all 176 of our colleagues who have been murdered since 1986, he has also, in effect, declared open season to silence the media.\"\nThe US-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said the remarks \"give security officials the right to kill for acts that they consider defamation\".\n\"This is one of the most outrageous statements we have ever heard from a president in the Philippines,\" said CPJ's Shawn Crispin in Bangkok.\nThe news conference was a typically strident appearance by the man nicknamed \"The Punisher\" for his strict criminal policies in Davao.\nHere are some of the other main points:\nMr Duterte's popularity rests on his reputation as a crime-fighter.\nDuring his time as mayor of Davao crime fell sharply, but it also saw the rise of death squads and, according to rights-groups, at least tacit official approval of the murder of more than 1,000 people.\nSaying the new crackdown started \"now\", Mr Duterte promised to pay 3m pesos ($64,000; \u00c2\u00a344,000) to officials who capture suspected drug lords,\nIf any law enforcement agent was \"messing around with drugs and it comes to a fight, I want you to kill him personally\", he said.\nMr Duterte's new cabinet is mostly male - only two so far are women - and they were broadly seen as conservative choices.\nPerfecto Yasay, who has said talks are the only way to resolve the country's South China Sea disputes, was named foreign secretary.\nMr Duterte's former schoolmate, Carlos Dominguez, was named finance minister, and economics professor Ernesto Pernia will be economic planning minister.\nMore controversially, former marine Nicanor Faeldon was chosen to be head of the customs bureau.\nHe led a coup attempt in 2003 and in December took a group of protesters to a disputed island held by the Philippines, to a furious response from Beijing.\n\"We have this pact with the West, but I want everybody to know that we will be charting a course of our own.\"\nCurrently a staunch ally of the US and recipient of its protection, if not formal backing, in territorial disputes with China, Mr Duterte said the Philippines would no longer rely as much on Washington.\nThe US State Department responded by saying it had \"no problem whatsoever\" with bilateral talks among parties to South China Sea disputes, but that most would not be solved that way.\nMr Duterte said he was waiting for the results of the case The Philippines has before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, over disputed islands in the South China Sea.\n\"Then, with the advice of the cabinet, I might be able to proceed,\" he said. \"But you know, I am not ready to go to war.

The sector accounts for an estimated 5% of Botswana's GDP, and employs more labour than mining.\nIn addition, Botswana has a small domestic market of only two million people and having to compete head-to-head with South Africa is a challenge.\nBotswana needs to come up with unique enterprises to compete effectively with South Africa, says Dr Tebogo Seleka, executive director of the Botswana Institute for Development Policy Analysis (Bidpa).\n\"We are both in SACU (Southern African Customs Union), that means goods can enter freely, so if we chose those enterprises that South Africa is more competitive at, that puts us at a disadvantage,\" he says.\nThe key to Botswana's future diversity, many believe, lies in private sector development, and attracting foreign direct investment.\nDr Seleka also believes that due to the country's proximity, combined with its diminutive population, investors tend to set up shop next door.\n\"If a firm from overseas wants to locate in southern Africa, because of Botswana's market size we are at a disadvantage,\" Dr Seleka says.\n\"We also need to look at technology readiness, if you look at the types of technologies firms use, and the rate of adoption of new technologies in Botswana it is still not up to scratch.\"\nOne of the solutions to beefing up diversity in the country's economy may lie with its most abundant animal population.\nCattle outnumber the human population by over a million, and beef is the country's third-largest earner.\nBut despite this, agriculture, in its entirety, only makes up 3% of Botswana's economy.\nBakang Tsheboagae, a cattle farmer from Dutlwe, a village in the Kweneng District of Botswana, says the techniques his family have used for generations to manage their cattle herds have hindered his growth.\nHistorically our way of tracking cattle are earmarks, which are identical, and you can only brand them once they reach a certain age,\" he says.\n\"Livestock multiply, and as you multiply it becomes so difficult to count them, or to know which one is where.\"\nBotswana's cattle and beef industry is driven by exports to Europe, and in order export their beef, farmers must produce traceability records.\n\"I would say whoever has livestock; small, medium or large scale, ultimately you need a tool that will help you account for whatever you are doing,\" says Mr Tsheboagae.\nEnter a new breed of entrepreneur, using technology to modernise the sector.\nThuto Gaotingwe, 26, has developed cattle tracking software Modisar - named after the Tswana word for a herd boy.\nMr Gaotingwe has managed to realise his vision through the help of a one of the government's new entrepreneurial incubators, the Botswana Innovation Hub.\nKnown as a \"quasi government institution\", the innovation hub is described on its website as part of the state's \"national strategic goal for the diversification of the country's economy\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 set up to support new ventures and existing companies.\"\nModisar is a productivity software application that can be installed on a farmer's computer or laptop, and allows the farmer to capture information about his or her farm faster.\nMr Gaotingwe explains: \"We are trying to say, 'look you can make money off livestock farming, only if you do it the right way'.\n\"So we have built Modisar, and it allows farmers to keep records of his farm assets. Then it allows farmers to know more about livestock diseases.\"\nAlthough criticised for being reactive as opposed to proactive, the government has implemented a number of policies, strategies and incentive schemes to encourage diversification.\nAn Economic Diversifiation Drive (EDD), for example, has been implemented to strengthen the private sector.\nThe EDD plans to leverage the government's purchasing power, estimated at $2.1bn (\u00c2\u00a31.3bn) per annum, to stimulate local production and consumption by buying from locally based manufacturers and service providers.\nLinah Mohohlo also explains that government has also begun exploring diversification options with in mining sector.\n\"You are now seeing other minerals, such as coal, uranium, copper, nickel coming on-stream,\" says Ms Mohohlo.\nDespite facing obstacles, with the right long-term developmental strategies, Botswana has huge potential to diversify.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "In Africa, Botswana is often seen as a diamond in the rough.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

You've got to find the resources, the facilities and the people,\" he told the BBC.\nHowever, Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman, the national lead for firearms, said last month that the majority of new armed officers will be in place by April 2017.\nThe latest announcement comes after 84 people were killed when a lorry ploughed into a large crowd watching a fireworks display in Nice in the south of France last month.\nLondoners and tourists out enjoying the August sunshine in central London report mixed feelings about more armed police patrolling the city's streets.\nTeacher Julie Banks, who was visiting from Liverpool, says she finds the news reassuring, \"especially at this time of year when there are more tourists and crowds.

It's important the people in charge of this weaponry are the right people who are going to protect us.\"\nSir Bernard said: \"We have no intelligence that there will be an attack shortly but what we do know is what we have seen in western Europe.\n\"We have seen attacks in Germany, in Belgium, in France and we would be foolish to ignore that, so it's important that we get officers out there with firearms to respond.\"\nThe commissioner said the increased firearms teams would be patrolling randomly around the clock.\nIt comes after he told a newspaper that a terror attack on the UK is highly likely and a case of \"when, not if\". Writing in the Mail on Sunday, the Met chief said there was a \"sense of fear\" in Britain.\nMr Khan said: \"It's really important that Londoners are reassured that the police service, that the security service, that all of us are doing our bit to keep Londoners in our city safe...\n\"The threat level hasn't changed but we are learning the lessons from Europe, from Nice, from Paris, from Munich.\"\nBy BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani\nThe Metropolitan Police have long aimed to make the capital as \"hostile\" an environment as possible for any would-be attacker to carry out a mass-casualty attack.\nBut if they can't stop someone attacking, the goal is to have enough armed police available to get to the scene of an atrocity quickly to minimise casualties and neutralise the threat.\nArmed police reached the scene of the 2013 killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby 11 minutes after the 999 call. The attackers were not armed with automatic weapons and just stood there waiting for police to arrive, rather than attacking anyone else.\nClearly, in a Paris-style scenario, 11 minutes is a long, long time so a great deal of today's security planning aims to accelerate how quickly specialist firearms officers could reach a scene.\nNone of which addresses a much bigger issue: what if the attack isn't in London, Birmingham or Manchester? Major cities may be well-resourced - but preparing to respond to an incident elsewhere is far more challenging.\nThe Met said the new armed officers would be \"working alongside their neighbourhood and specialist colleagues\", and Mr Khan said there would be a second dedicated PC in every London ward by the end of next year.\nIn Munich, Germany, nine people died in a shooting at a shopping centre in July while in November 2015, gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people in Paris.\nMeanwhile, Mr White expressed his concern about the time it would take to put the plan in place.\n\"What we've got to make sure is that we have the resources in the right place at the right time and we've also got to recognise that this isn't London-centric... a terrorist attack could happen anywhere in the country.\"\nFirearms officers in the Metropolitan Police have to undergo a comprehensive selection and training process before they are allowed on to the streets with a gun.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "More armed police are to be seen on patrol in London, Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan have said.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

He also claims that digital downloads were undercounted.\nIn a statement, Carpenter said he had been unable to resolve the dispute without suing.\n\"The Carpenters recordings are among the best sellers in the history of popular music, and after 48 years continue to contribute a substantial amount to [Universal's] annual bottom line,\" he wrote. \"It seems only fair that these companies account fairly to my sister's estate and to me.\"\nSpecialising in radio-friendly soft rock, The Carpenters sold millions of records in the 1970s. The brother-sister duo won three Grammy Awards in 1970 and 1971, including best new artist and best vocal performance for the ballad (They Long to Be) Close to You.\nThe band's career was cut short when Karen developed anorexia nervosa in 1975. Although they continued to record, the condition eventually led to her death, from heart failure.\nRichard Carpenter's legal claim is one of many filed in the US after a 2010 court case involving Eminem, which resulted in a ruling that artists should receive higher royalty payments for digital downloads than they do when a CD or vinyl album is sold.\nThe difference is substantial. According to Billboard, artists get 15% of the money generated by the sale of a record. For downloads, which are counted as \"licensed content\",  the figure 50%.\nArtists including Peter Frampton, Public Enemy, Whitesnake and The Temptations have all sued, or threatened to sue, in order to obtain the higher rate.\nUniversal Music were not immediately available to respond to the latest case.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

The other two were left behind when he was deported.\nThe conditions are extremely harsh, especially for the youngest. \"We sleep directly on the floor and it gets wet inside when it rains,\" Eleny explains.\nThe children were all born in the Dominican Republic itself.\nThey are showing signs of malnutrition and have developed a skin condition since arriving at the camp.\n\"They're very hungry, we all are, because we can only afford one meal a day,\" she says in Creole-accented Spanish.\nOne of the few local figures helping the returnees is the parish priest, Father Luc Leandre.\nWith funds from the International Organisation for Migration, he has helped relocate some of the most desperate families to nearby communities in Haiti.\n\"It's a grave crisis, very, very bad,\" Father Leandre tells me.\n\"The Church is like a mother for everyone and I have a duty to help. Not only that, the Pope told everyone they have to help the refugees wherever they are.\"\nBut Father Leandre says the attitude of some conservative priests on the other side of the border, particularly in the Dominican capital, Santo Domingo, has complicated his work.\n\"The cardinal in Santo Domingo is personally very vocal in his support for the deportations. He supported sending all the Haitians back to their country.\"\n\"It's racism,\" he laments, saying the law specifically targeted black Haitians, a charge denied by lawmakers in the Dominican Republic.\nThe priest Father Leandre was referring to has been the most influential voice in the Catholic Church in the Dominican Republic for almost 40 years: the controversial and outspoken Cardinal Nicolas de Jesus Lopez.\nEarlier this month, Pope Francis accepted the cardinal's resignation, which all archbishops are obliged to offer once they reach the age of 75.\nBut he will remain an important figure in the Church and in Dominican public life.\nThe BBC repeatedly requested an interview with Cardinal Nicolas de Jesus so he could respond to the criticisms against him but both he and his press secretary declined.\nIn many ways, the Haitian migrant crisis has exposed greater divisions within the Catholic Church in Hispaniola over where it should position itself in the 21st Century.\nPope Francis - both the first Jesuit pope and the first from Latin America - designated 2016 as the \"Year of Mercy\" and certainly Jesuits have been instrumental in supporting the Haitian returnees.\nIn a video that went viral, the cardinal was filmed in a furious diatribe about a Jesuit priest called Mario Serrano calling him \"shameless\" and a \"leftist\".\n\"He's not very accustomed to being publically confronted,\" Mario Serrano tells me from the northern border region of Dajabon, where he works with undocumented Haitians.\n\"I just said that (his) kind of speech was not according to the Catholic teaching and was not for a priest or a Christian.\n\"I think that really made him mad.\"\nSupporters of the new regularisation law, such as the former Dominican ambassador to the US, Flavio Espinal, deny that the legislation was either cruel or motivated by racism.\n\"Nothing's perfect and the process here has not been perfect. Yet this has been an extraordinary step forward in the direction of regularising close to 300,000 people who were undocumented in this country.\n\"That's not an easy decision to make nowadays.\"\nAt night, to avoid detection, the farmer Soinicier Giles leaves Parc Cadeau and slips back into the Dominican Republic, the border marked by the Pedernales River.\nThere he strips the trees for firewood to make charcoal, to sell to Dominican traders for a few dollars.\nHe knows the practice damages the fertility of the soil, but it's the only available source of income.\n\"This is the only way we can survive,\" he says, motioning at his family, stuck inside the world's forgotten migrant crisis.\nYou can hear more of Will Grant's report on Heart and Soul on the BBC World Service.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Immigration has long been a divisive issue on Hispaniola, the Caribbean island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Women's football in England is now worthy of that stage and as one of the first two teams to play this historic occasion, we will be proud to be part of another pioneering moment.\nIn the build-up to the game, some of my team-mates have been asking me about playing at Wembley, having played there for England against Germany last November and while representing Great Britain at the London 2012 Olympics.\nI can only say that it is a unique, out-of-body experience to play in front of so many people. It's a feeling that never gets old and we will be going to Wembley before Saturday so that those new to it can get a feel of the iconic 90,000-seat stadium.\nIn attempting to win Chelsea's first piece of silverware, it's the biggest game in the club's history, but one thing I've been telling them is we have to play the game and not the occasion.\nI wouldn't care if it was being played in a local park in Wembley, the most important thing is to win.\nWith Chelsea's men's team also playing at Wembley the following day when the Premier League champions take on FA Cup winners Arsenal in the Community Shield, we want to make it a historic weekend.\nThere are many players in our team who have won the FA Cup before, including myself.\nThe first time was in 2005 with Charlton when I scored the winner against Everton and in 2012 I was part of the Birmingham team which beat Chelsea on penalties following a 2-2 draw.\nIn our dressing room we have midfielder Katie Chapman, who has won the FA Cup eight times, and Gilly Flaherty, who has won it five times, so we are not lacking pedigree.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nBut having missed out on WSL so narrowly last season [on goal difference to Liverpool], it's fair to say that this could mean more because of the journey we have been on together.\nDespite losing our last two league games, we aren't panicking. We have strong characters in the dressing room and the belief that got us to the FA Cup final and saw us go unbeaten in 13 matches this year.\nThere has been plenty of talk about the fact that our unbeaten start to the league season has come to an end.\nIt would have been nice to hold onto that record, but the WSL is a very competitive league and every team in it has dropped points. We were the last to do so. We didn't play well in a 4-0 loss at Sunderland but the promoted side are now top of the league and our defeat by Manchester City last Sunday came courtesy of a very fortunate winner. Despite the result, our performance was pleasing.\nWe are a point off the top with five games left and to be in that position in such a competitive season is positive.\nOur focus is now on Saturday and we are confident we can win.\nAnother positive from the World Cup has been the boost to crowds in the WSL.\nThe first weekend after we arrived back saw record numbers for Manchester City, while 2,061 watched Liverpool beat Arsenal, and more than 1,200 saw us beat Bristol.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThree weeks after our return, the bounce has lasted. Our first home defeat in more than 18 months by Manchester City was watched by a club-record 1,857 at Staines FC.\nThose numbers are a credit to marketing staff at WSL clubs and the players, who are obviously putting on a good show in order to entice supporters back. The time we spend with fans immediately after games also helps too, I think.\nThe test now comes when the Premier League starts on 8 August.\nWith the Continental Cup now under way again, our season doesn't end until October, so hopefully the upsurge in attendances will continue and women's football will still very much be something people want to watch.\nEngland and Chelsea forward Eniola Aluko was speaking to BBC Sport's Alistair Magowan.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Since returning from the Women's World Cup, it's been a pleasant surprise that more and more people have approached me in the street and congratulated England on finishing third.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

It's full of eccentric and downright misleading reports,\" said Prof Bryan Sykes, from Oxford University.\nThe researchers will apply a systematic approach and employ the latest advances in genetic testing, aiming to publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n\"There have been DNA tests done on alleged yetis and other such things but since then the testing techniques, particularly on hair, have improved a lot due to advances in forensic science,\" the Oxford geneticist told Reuters news agency.\nModern testing could get valid results from a fragment of a shaft of hair, added Prof Sykes, who is leading the project with Michel Sartori, director of the Lausanne Museum of Zoology.\nA 1951 expedition to Mount Everest famously returned with photographs of giant footprints in the snow, fuelling speculation about giant Himalayan creatures, unknown to science.\nSince then, many eye-witness reports of such creatures have emerged from remote regions of the world.\nThese humanoid beasties are variously known as the \"yeti\" or \"migoi\" in the Himalayas, \"bigfoot\" or \"sasquatch\" in North America, \"almasty\" in the Caucasus mountains and \"orang pendek\" in Sumatra, but there are many others.\nTests up to now have usually concluded that alleged yeti remains were in fact human. But, said Prof Sykes, \"there has been no systematic review of this material.\"\nThe project will focus on an archive of remains held at the Lausanne museum that was assembled by Bernard Heuvelmans, a Belgian-French biologist who investigated reported yeti sightings from 1950 up to his death in 2001.\nOther institutions and individuals will also be asked to send in details of any possible yeti material.\nAside from the yeti question, Prof Sykes said he hoped the project would add to the growing body of knowledge on the interaction between different human species in the past.\n\"In the last two years it has become clear that there was considerable interbreeding between  \n          Homo sapiens and Neanderthals ... about 2% to 4% of the DNA of each individual European is Neanderthal,\" he said.\nThose who are favourable to the idea of as-yet undescribed creatures say the yeti and orang pendek could represent survivals of  \n          Homo erectus,  \n          Homo floresiensis (the Indonesian \"Hobbit\") or  \n          Gigantopithecus - a giant ape that once inhabited the forests of East Asia. The idea has even spawned the term \"cryptozoology\" to describe the search for such beasts.\nOthers are highly sceptical of such tales, and consider the subject unworthy of serious scientific investigation.\nAsked about the project's chances of success, Prof Sykes said: \"The answer is, of course, I don't know,\" adding, \"it's unlikely, but on the other hand if we don't examine it we won't know.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "A UK-Swiss team will use DNA testing to investigate the origins of remains claimed to be from yeti and bigfoot.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Its internal politics have caused a logjam in approvals but the EU science budget is also funding some of Britain's research.\nEurope grows very few GM plants but most of its imported animal feed is genetically modified.\nIt was America's agricultural giants whose hard sell of GM put off so many European consumers but it is also US science that provides the evidence, gathered over the past two decades, that supports the assurance that GM plants and food are safe.\nAnd while Britain's leading plant scientists appeal to the prime minister to help foster this new technology, its leading supermarket chains avoid stocking GM products because no-one is asking for them.\nSo can anything shift? The key is whether ministers can change minds in Brussels - and that's no easy task given the hostility towards GM in big players like France and Germany.\nA long haul lies ahead.\nEnvironment Secretary Owen Paterson has spoken in favour of increasing UK research into GM, which he said offers the \"most wonderful opportunities to improve human health.\"\nThe CST was asked by Prime Minister David Cameron for the latest evidence on the risks and benefits of GM technologies in agriculture, and for advice on UK and EU regulation.\nIn turn, it commissioned a group of leading plant scientists from Rothamsted Research, The Sainsbury Laboratory and Cambridge University to make recommendations to the prime minister.\nThe scientists say they are being held back by strict EU regulations - based on the principle that GM crops are inherently more dangerous than conventionally-bred varieties.\nOnly two GM varieties have been licensed for commercial harvest in Europe - despite the fact that 12% of the world's arable land is cultivating GM crops.\nThe CST report argues GM crops have now been shown to be safe - and may be necessary in future for Britain to grow its own food supply, rather than depending on imports.\nIt says the UK should regulate commercial GM varieties of wheat and potatoes based on their individual benefits and risks - rather than follow the EU's blanket approach.\nIt also recommends a new programme of publicly-funded field trials to test \"public good\" GM crop varieties, which it calls \"PubGM\".\n\"Public good\" traits could include nutritional enhancement, such as antioxidants in tomatoes, or vitamin A in \"Golden Rice\".\nThey could also include \"climate-proofing\" properties such as drought resistance or heat resistance.\n\"With PubGM, seed companies, consumers and regulators will be able to decide, based on results of experiments, whether a GM trait has proved its worth in UK crops under UK conditions,\" said Professor Jonathan Jones from The Sainsbury Laboratory, one of the report's authors.\nSir Mark Walport, chief scientific adviser and CST co-chair, said: \"We take it for granted that because our shelves in supermarkets are heaving with food there are no problems in food security. But there are.\n\"We're part of a global food market. Competition is likely to increase. The world is already malnourished and the population is growing.\n\"The challenge is to get more yield from the same area. GM is not a magic bullet, but it is one of a range of technologies that we should consider.\"\nThe report was welcomed by Dr Julian Little, chair of the Agricultural Biotechnology Council (ABC), which represents companies including BASF, Monsanto and Syngenta.\n\"Current EU regulation has moved in the direction of increasing political influence and undermining science.\n\"Europe risks being left behind and it therefore remains essential that action is taken to address the dysfunctional EU approvals process so that UK farmers may, in the future, be able to realise the potential of great British biotechnology research right here in the UK.\"\nBut the environmental group Friends of the Earth say GM will not make food more affordable or sustainable.\n\"GM crops have been hugely over-hyped. Despite decades of research they have failed to deliver the benefits they have promised - and have been an expensive distraction from real solutions to the challenges we face,\" said senior food campaigner Vicki Hird.\n\"Our food production system needs a radical overhaul to ensure everyone has access to healthy, affordable food that doesn't wreck the planet - but putting more power into the hands of multi-nationals is not the answer.\"\nProf Cathie Martin, of the John Innes Centre, one of the creators of GM purple tomatoes, said changing regulations would help scientists make progress with GM varieties that benefit society.\nShe told BBC News: \"It takes 10 years to get European regulators to approve a new GM trial, and costs in the order of $150m. How can any small company do that?\"\n\"NGOs complain that GM only benefits multinational companies - but that's because they're the only ones who can afford it. We can't afford to trial crops for the public good.\n\"If this promotes field trials where you can look at something for the public good that would be fantastic.\"\nDan Crossley, executive director of the Food Ethics Council, said: \"This report, like many focussing on GM technology, is framed around the question 'how can science and technology help secure global food supplies'.\n\"Instead we need to ask people at the sharp end of food insecurity what can be done - by scientists and also by others - to help fix the food system.\n\"In a resource-constrained world where a billion people go to bed hungry and a billion are obese, we must also tackle the scandal of food waste, as well as the issue of what we eat.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "A new report on genetically modified (GM) crops, commissioned by the prime minister, calls for more UK field trials and fewer EU restrictions.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The proportion getting A* to C grades has nudged up from 68.8% to 69%.\nThat represents an improvement for more than 10,000 exam entries. But the overall message - and the even smaller decline in the proportion of top A* and A grades - is that there is \"stability\".\nThis isn't an accident. The annual exam results are not like going outside and measuring the temperature as a natural phenomenon which might fluctuate.\nIt's more like setting the central heating to an agreed level and then holding up a thermometer to see if the temperature is where it should be.\nWell, perhaps that's not a complete analogy, but the national exam statistics, with their neat similarity to last year, are a work of design rather than nature.\nThe huge annual challenge for the exam system is to balance a number of competing demands. There has to be room for some slight ups and downs, but there mustn't be grade inflation, standards have to be maintained over time and - at the very heart of the process - it has to be a fair reward for the hard work of individual pupils.\nAdd to this complex equation the need to adjust grades between different exam boards.\nHead teachers' leader Brian Lightman has complained that below the smooth surface of the national statistics, there can be doubts about the reliability of individual results.\nHe has warned of \"volatility\", with heads unable to explain sudden dips and spikes, problems that remain unnoticed from a national perspective.\n\"It is devastating for a student who has been on course for a certain grade to miss what they were expected to achieve and it is mystifying to their teachers,\" said Mr Lightman.\nThe lingering question is if one year's results are reverse engineered to be very similar to the year before, does this mean distorting some of the results to make sure that they fit? Are there winners and losers in some subjects and at some grades?\nOfqual has always argued that fairness for individual students is not compromised by the demands of the wider results system.\nBut it's a massively complicated challenge for exam boards and regulator - made even more difficult by the conflicting legacies of previous grading systems.\nOnce there was a system of fixed quotas which prevented any rise in grades and then a system which allowed grades to rise every single year. Now there is a system which holds out the possibility of change, but which manages to keep things the same.\nAnother factor that gets overlooked in the headlines, is that the results can be changed by who is taking the exam.\nThis year's nudge upwards in the pass rate has come alongside an older cohort.\nThere are fewer 14 and 15 year olds taking the GCSEs early, because the league tables now only recognise the first attempt.\nAnd another change in government policy means that pupils who missed out on GCSE maths and English last year are having to re-sit the exam this year. This means that more than 300,000 exam entries were from 17 year olds.\nBut if the changes at the overall level are measured in fractions of a percentage point, there are some very striking differences between England, Northern Ireland and Wales.\nNorthern Ireland's pupils are stretching their lead over everyone else, jumping by 0.7% to 78.7%. It raises the question how such results can be achieved when only 66% make the grade in Wales.\nNot only is the Northern Ireland figure far ahead of England, it is ahead of the highest-achieving part of England, which was London with 72%.\nEngland's education system has been in a state of almost constant reform since the late 1980s, but the latest results show it is Northern Ireland that is stretching further ahead.\nWhen these regional differences are overlaid with the gender gap, it means that young women in Northern Ireland are doing much better than anyone else.\nThe scores from the GCSE top grades show the gap. Among entries from female pupils in Northern Ireland, 11.4% achieve A* grades. Among male pupils in Wales, the figure is 4.5%.\nIn England, 5.2% of entries from male pupils and 7.9% of female achieve these highest A* grades.\nThis sets a pattern for A-levels and university entry, with Northern Irish women the most likely in the UK to get university places.\nWhether or not it is going to be consolation for England's school leaders, such comparisons are soon going to be impossible.\nBecause in a couple of years England's GCSEs will begin to be graded from 9 to 1 rather than A to G, ending a common system with Wales and Northern Ireland.\nAnother curious aside is that many of the pupils taking GCSEs this year in England did not take their Sats tests five years ago, because of a primary school teachers' boycott. What difference did it make in the long term?\nIt would take another exam to answer that one.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "The results have been published for more than five million GCSE entries - which will be five million different stories of exam dreams, dramas and disasters.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

He expressed disappointment that England's World Cup qualifying win in Moldova knocked the Paralympics off the back pages on Saturday morning.\nBut that is for the future and this is still the time to reflect on what International Paralmpic Committee president Sir Philip Craven described as \"the greatest Paralympic Games ever\".\nAnd on the achievements of Britain in staging such successful Games as Lord Coe explained in his speech:\n\"There are some famous words you can find stamped on the bottom of a product.

I'm very optimistic that within this new formula, the Kurds will achieve their historic demand and right [to independence]\".\n\"We have passed through bitter experiences since the formation of the Iraqi state after World War One. We tried to preserve the unity of Iraq, but we are not responsible for its fragmentation - it's the others who broke it up.\n\"We don't want to be part of the chaos and problems which surround Iraq from all sides.\"\nPresident Barzani said the drive for independence was very serious, and that preparations were going ahead \"full steam\".\nHe said the first step should be \"serious negotiations\" with the central government in Baghdad to reach an understanding and a solution, towards what Kurdish leaders are optimistically calling an \"amicable separation\".\nIf that did not produce results, he said, the Kurds should go ahead unilaterally with a referendum on independence.\n\"It's a necessary step, because all the previous attempts and experiments failed. If current conditions aren't helpful for independence, there are no circumstances which favour not demanding this right.\"\nIraq's Kurds are landlocked and surrounded by neighbours - Syria, Turkey, Iran and Iraq itself - which have traditionally quashed Kurdish aspirations.\nUnder threat from IS, they are more dependent than ever on Western powers which are also strongly counselling them to stick with Iraq.\nBut whether or not the Iraqi Kurds achieve full formal independence in the near future, they have already established an entity with borders, a flag, international airports, a parliament and government, and its own security forces - everything except a passport and their own currency.\nTo that extent, they have already redrawn the map. And next door in northern Syria, their fellow Kurds are essentially doing the same, controlling and running large swathes of land along the Turkish border under the title of \"self-administration\".\nAs for IS, its territorial gains have already peaked. But the chaos in both Iraq and Syria that allowed it to take root have yet to run their course - the alienation of Iraq's Sunni Arab minority (and the Kurds), and Syria's fragmentation in a vicious sectarian civil war.\nThe unspoken struggle is over whether formulas can be found for different communities to live together within the borders bequeathed by 20th Century history, or whether new frontiers will have to be drawn to accommodate those peoples - however that concept is defined.\n\"Sykes-Picot is finished, that's for sure, but everything is now up in the air, and it will be a long time before it becomes clear what the result will be,\" said the veteran Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt.\nThe Sykes-Picot agreement conflicted directly with pledges of freedom given by the British to the Arabs in exchange for their support against the collapsing Ottomans.\nIt also collided with the vision of the US President Woodrow Wilson, who preached self-determination for the peoples subjugated by the Ottoman Empire.\nHis foreign policy adviser Edward House was later informed of the agreement by UK Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour, who 18 months on was to put his name to a declaration which was to have an even more fateful impact on the region.\nHouse wrote: \"It is all bad and I told Balfour so. They are making it a breeding place for future war.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Reaching its centenary amidst a general chorus of vilification around the region, the legacy of the secret Sykes-Picot agreement of 1916 has never looked more under assault.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

I met a good agent quite early on in my career after some bad experiences. He took care of negotiations, which is standard, made sure I was pitching myself at the right amount of money to be earning weekly, monthly, annually.\nOn top of that he helped me with financial advice, he helped me with marketing, exit strategies when I finished football, and also just day-to-day things. He was always preaching to do your best and try to look after yourself.\nThe influence that agents have got now in the game is unbelievable. You look at some of the biggest clubs in the UK and Europe, and there are certain super agents who, for me, have too much power.\nIn relation to deals, I think the money should be capped in some way. If you're doing a deal for a player moving for \u00a31m, why would there be another \u00a31m going missing to agents' fees? It's unacceptable, for me, that kind of money going out of the game, when that could be easily used for grassroots football.\nJonathan Barnett of the Stellar Group\nAgents have a bad reputation because nobody really understands what an agent does and that includes, probably, the FA. It's not deserved. More MPs have committed illegal acts than agents. I think it's unjust, a very unjust one.\nPeople get confused when they hear of an agent. They think it's somebody that does transfers, runs around from one club to another trying to sell players. They are more traders and brokers. There are very few of those agents and very few that really matter.\nHowever, what we are as an agency and what other reputable companies are, are people who look after players. We don't look after clubs. We don't look after anybody else, we look after the player. And by that, we make sure their life is properly run, any problems are taken care of and their life is made very easy so that all they can do is concentrate on playing football.\nWe get paid for what we're worth. If we do a good job for our player then we get paid. If we do a bad job, we don't. There are plenty of agents who don't earn a living. You've got to be good at what you do and then you get paid rightly.\nStoke City chairman Peter Coates\nFootball clubs, especially top clubs, are getting more and more income, so what happens? Players get bigger and bigger wages, and agents therefore get bigger and bigger fees. It's a product of the marketplace we're in, so I'm not surprised.\nI wish it were less, but we're in a marketplace that is highly competitive. We've never been able to get any traction and get an agreement to say we'll all dock pay more than X, whether it's 5%, 10% or whatever the figure could be. There seems a reluctance to go down that route. There's no other way we could perhaps rein in what agents get.\nThere are good agents, less good agents and they can earn huge amounts of money. That sometimes can attract the wrong sort of person because the prize is so high. It's one of those facts of life. We wish it was different, but we seem incapable of controlling it. All clubs do their best, obviously we don't want to pay any more than we have to. But it's a tough market.

The scale of the dark web - with its drug deals, weapons sales and child abuse imagery - is insignificant when considered in the bigger picture, he argues.\nBut we must talk about the former. I meet Dingledine at this year's Def Con, the large underground hacking convention held in Las Vegas.\nThe timing was ideal - the event came just over a week after the closure of two huge dark web marketplaces. The biggest, Alphabay, was said to boast more than 200,000 users and $1bn (\u00a30.7bn) a year in revenue.\nDingledine's talk was the day prior to our meeting, and in it he criticised misinformed journalists for sensationalising the size and scale of the dark web.\n\"I think a lot of it comes down to incentive mismatches,\" he tells me, \"where journalists have to create more controversy and get something so that everybody will want to read their article.\n\"The story is privacy is under threat around the world, and that's been the story for a while - so they need a new story.\"\nThe Tor Project's website has a section called \"Abuse FAQ\".\nIt is here the group attempts to address the most controversial side of Tor use: that it is an enabler of criminals intent on carrying out the most shocking and sickening crimes.\nWhen talking about this, Dingledine invokes the \"guns don't kill people\" defence. Tor does not commit crime, he says, criminals do.\n\"I would say that there are bad people on the internet and they're doing bad things, but Tor does not enable them to do the bad things.\n\"It's not like there's a new set of bad people in the world who exist because Tor exists.\"\nI guess not. But I suggest that Tor indisputably provides a way in which a novice can make themselves essentially untraceable online.\n\"I still think that most of the bad stuff on the internet has nothing to do with Tor,\" Dingledine insists.\n\"Most of the bad stuff on the internet is due to huge criminal organisations. There's a lot of crime out there.\"\nIn layman's terms, Tor hides your identity by pinging your connection around many different servers across the world, making your actual location extremely hard to track.\nThere have been rumours that law enforcement has \"cracked\" Tor but, aside from isolated vulnerabilities, Dingledine says the concept remains solid.\n\"As far as I know, no, they haven't [cracked Tor].\n\"Tor is the best option there is out there, but that doesn't mean Tor is perfect. No software is perfect.\"\nAny major busts and arrests have been traced back to human error - good old, old-fashioned policing.\n\"Which is frustrating,\" Dingledine interjects, \"Because the modern police world wants to just click a button and have the bad guy show up. Old-fashioned police work is hard, takes energy.\"\nTor was mentioned in the documents leaked as part of Edward Snowden's whistleblowing in 2014. Under the delicate heading \"Tor Stinks\u2026 but it could be worse\", the National Security Agency (NSA) noted: \"We will never be able to de-anonymise all Tor users all the time.\"\nGiven this, you would think the US (and others) would be taking every step to weaken Tor. Ban it, even. But in fact, the US government has done more than any other to keep it alive - donating several million dollars to Dingledine and team since the project's inception in the nineties.\nHe is confident that funding will continue.\n\"A lot of the US government funding for internet freedom tools comes from Republicans. The current congress is quite supportive of giving people tools to keep people safer on the internet.\"\nThe reason? The FBI, CIA, military and others all value anonymity too.

It spoke not just to the predicament his team were in against a nation ranked 176th in the world but also to Scotland's previous opening days in major championship qualification.\nThe 0-0 draw against Lithuania that got the Euro 2000 campaign off to a grim start. The 2-2 draw against the Faroes in the first round of matches for Euro 2004. The 0-0 draw with Slovenia in week one of the qualifiers for World Cup 2006.\nThe loss to Macedonia on the first day of the campaign to make the World Cup in 2010. The draw with Lithuania that put Scotland on the back foot straight away in the Euro 2012 qualifiers. The draw with Serbia that did the same for World Cup 2014.\nScotland failed to qualify for all those tournaments, as if anybody needs reminding.\n\"Everybody was concerned,\" said Strachan, about half-time in Malta. \"But we had a bunch of lads who could deal with the stress.\"\nScotland had enjoyed 72.5% possession in that opening half and their dominance of the ball wasn't reflected in a dominance on the scoreboard.\nThis is not unusual when teams play Malta, but it's still unsettling at the time. Lots of possession doesn't always mean lots of goals. Malta can be slapstick but, on their very best days, they can also be stuffy.\nStrachan would have known that. Maybe that's where the mention of a \"crisis\" came from, a realisation that while the minnows don't win matches, they do have the capacity, from time to time, to frustrate.\nIn the qualifiers for Euro 2016, Italy had 71% possession (and a one-man advantage for 46 minutes) against Malta and yet only scored once against them. In the return match, they had 70% possession and again they broke down their opponents only once.\nIn the same group, Croatia had their issues with the Maltese. They, like Italy, had a one-man advantage, for 59 minutes, and enjoyed 70% of the ball but only scored twice, the second coming nine minutes from the end. In their second game with Malta, they had 64% possession and only won 1-0. Strachan had mentioned their stuffiness in the preamble. At half-time, that fear wouldn't have been far from his mind.\nIn fairness to them, Scotland picked up the banana skin and flung it out of their road. At 2-1, they had retaken control of the game, then they benefited from a horrific refereeing error that gave them a penalty they didn't deserve, a decision that also unjustly reduced Malta to 10 men with half-an-hour left.\nIn the Euro qualifiers, 10-man Malta managed to batten down the hatches against the 11 men of Italy and Croatia but they couldn't repeat the trick against Scotland. Strachan's team got seriously lucky with the penalty and the red card, but they made the most of it. Five goals is a hell of a return when so many would have settled for one, as long as it was decisive.\nWhat did Sunday night tell us? It told us that Strachan's favoured centre-halves, Russell Martin and Grant Hanley, had better start playing games for their clubs - they're out of the picture at Norwich and Newcastle - before the next round of qualifiers in October. In a worrying opening half the pair of them were rusty and vulnerable, even to the pea-shooters of Malta.\nIt told us that Ollie Burke has a lot to offer, that in James McArthur's absence, Barry Bannan's surprise selection was justified and that in Leigh Griffiths' absence - and the increasingly perplexing omission of Ross McCormack - Chris Martin scored an important goal to make it 2-1.\nIt also told us that Matt Ritchie's delivery from out wide could be invaluable. Above all, it reminded us that Robert Snodgrass is not just a terrific footballer, but he's also a fine leader - and if there was luck involved in his hat-trick then it was not before time. Injury robbed him of 16 months of his career. The man is due some payback.\nScotland's record on the opening day of major championship qualifying campaigns is lamentable, but this team has spared itself the misery of its predecessors. They can look to Lithuania at Hampden on 8 October with a bit of confidence.\nLike the Malta game, that's a must-win. Lithuania drew 2-2 with Slovenia on Sunday having led 2-0 after 34 minutes. They're already weakened by that result. Scotland can deal them a major blow by beating them next month. Prepare to forget about qualification if they don't.\nWe can only talk in ball-park numbers when trying to figure out how many points Scotland may need to make the play-offs - presuming that England, though hugely uninspired in victory against Slovakia, go on and win the group.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nFor the 2014 World Cup, Croatia, Iceland and France made the play-offs with 17 points. All the other nations that made the play-offs could have got there with 18, although some ended up with more than 18.\nFour years earlier, and because Scotland's group was so lamentably bad - Norway finished second with a feeble 10 points, 11 points would have got a team to the play-offs. That was a highly unusual campaign, though.\nOver those past two World Cup qualifying campaigns the 16 teams that advanced to the play-offs had an average of 20 points each. That's why home and away victories against Malta and Lithuania are vital. It's why Slovakia and Slovenia need to be beaten at some stage, home or away. Even then, Scotland may need to garner some draws to top up their total.\nScotland have been a mile off that standard. In the last three World Cup qualifying series they finished on 11 points (2014), 10 points (2010) and 13 points (2006).\nScotland being Scotland, even when they got off to a flier (Euro 2008 campaign) and had nine points out of nine (including a win over France) and 12 points from a possible 15 at the start, they still didn't make it. None of this will be easy, but it's not supposed to be.\nThe encouraging thing is that, on Sunday, they leaped over the first hurdle, an obstacle they usually thunder into before crashing to the floor. The barriers only get bigger from here. But, then, the prize, is pretty huge, too.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "The ghosts of failures past must have been swirling around Gordon Strachan's ears at half-time in Malta on Sunday night.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Two Chinese researchers demonstrated a photo-realistic talking head - type in some text and he'll say anything you want, blinking and moving almost like a real person.\nCraig Mundie says the success of Kinect, which racked up 8m sales in its first 60 days, is proof that the sheer scale of Microsoft's R&D strategy is paying off.\n\"Microsoft is at a point where many of the things that we've been researching for twenty years are starting to add up and produce solutions,\" he says. \"You can't rely on two guys in a garage to make all the changes, some of these things require a huge amount of technology and a lot of scale.\"\nBut Microsoft desperately needed a hit from its research labs.\nEver since Bill Gates decided 20 years ago that the company would spend big bucks on trying to see into the future, there have been ideas aplenty but few stand out products. A decade ago, for instance, Gates was showing off tablet computers - but it took Apple and its iPad to make them mainstream.\nPeter Lee, who runs the Redmond lab, says the research operation has a wide remit, from dealing with instant fixes to current products to blue-sky thinking.\nProfessor Lee, who joined Microsoft last year after a distinguished academic career and a spell at the US defence agency DARPA, insists the labs are having an impact  on a daily basis.\nHe cites the contribution to what he describes as the \"holy war in search\", the battle between Google and Microsoft's Bing.\n\"Hour by hour we have a large group of researchers actively involved in Bing, constantly adding new research advances into the product.\"\nBut he thinks the long-term research is equally important.\n\"Some call it navel-gazing, we call it pushing back the frontiers of human knowledge,\" he says with a smile, predicting that his lab will one day win a Nobel prize.\nHis boss Craig Mundie is Microsoft's big thinker, charting the path of its future research. His current obsession is what he calls natural user interfaces, new ways of interacting with computers, of which Kinect is one example.\nThere is, he says, a shift about to happen from the old graphical user interface to a trend where \"the computer is more like us - it sees, it listens, it speaks, it understands, it even seeks to do things on our behalf.\"\nIt is an intriguing vision, but here's a sobering fact. All these clever ideas, smart people, and major investment have not stopped Microsoft from being overtaken in the last year in terms of market value by Apple, which seems to focus on the customer experience now, rather than five years down the line.\nBig, sleepy, and dull, I suggested to Mr Mundie, is how many people now perceive Microsoft.\n\"We don't feel big and sleepy or dull,\" he responded, \"but if people perceive us that way I think looking at the stuff that Kinect brings should change that view.\"\nAnd he insists that firms that do not have the patience to spend on long-term research will lose out in the end.\n\"I don't think any company is going to prevail over a long period of time in giving good business returns, if they aren't making these kind of investments. They'll come and go in a generation if they don't have the staying power that's produced by having real mastery of the underlying technologies.\"\nMicrosoft, which still generates huge revenues from its core products, Windows and Office, can well afford to keep spending on its blue-sky thinking. But having made such a big bet on science, it will be hoping that the coming years will produce more Kinects, and fewer tablet PCs.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "If you spent $9bn a year on research and development and employed 900 of the world's top computer scientists to come up with new ideas, what would you expect in return?", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

We then follow that carbon which has been fixed by the plant into the soil and into the microbes and back out of the soil.\"\nHe added that the experiment would provide data on how novel crops, such as miscanthus, introduced carbon into the soil and how stable it was once it was in the ground.\n\"As you can see, miscanthus is very different from anything you would see normally,\" he observed.\n\"It originates from Asia and so there has not been a lot of work done on it and the carbon tracer approach is a very good way of seeing how much carbon fixed by the plant will stay in the soil a year later.\"\nAnother experiment the team are carrying out involves taking a metre-deep soil sample, which co-researcher Rebecca Rowe describes as \"quite unusual\".\n\"A lot of soil science, at the moment, is done to about 30cm, partly for practical reasons as coring to a metre is difficult,\" she said.\nDigging deep\nIn order to extract the metre-long sample, the team have to enlist the help of \"Kevin\", an adapted road-breaker.\n\"Also because a lot of arable crops or grassland crops the rooting depths are much shallower, a lot of the changes are happening in the top 30cm,\" Dr Rowe told BBC News.\n\"Obviously, with energy crops that are in the ground for 20-25 years, we are looking at a lot longer timescale and a greater depth for rooting so it is important for us to go deeper.\"\nDr Rowe is 12 months into a three-year project that involves collecting metre soil samples all over the UK.\n\"We could just do it here at our Lincolnshire site, but then we would only be able to say what is happening with soil carbon in this location in this soil type,\" she explained.\n\"By going all over the country, we can look at different soil types and different climates - the South-West is very different  to, say, southern Scotland.\n\"It gives us a much better idea of what the overall effect on soil carbon may be in all of the sites across the UK with growing things like willow, miscanthus and different arable crops as well.\"\n(Source: UK Bioenergy Strategy)\nDr McNamara said the data would be used to develop a model, developed by researchers from Aberdeen University and other partners, to show how growing bioenergy crops would affect an area of land's soil carbon characteristics.\n\"Our plan is to make a model universally available to the community, so a user could download our model and then - for example - predict what would happen if they converted their land to bioenergy crops in terms of the implication for soil carbon and greenhouse gas emissions,\" he said.\nThe project - commissioned and funded by the Energy Technologies Institute, with additional funding from the Natural Environment Research Council - would, Dr McNamara added, help address the concern over the scarcity of data on bioenergy crops and carbon cycling, and allow policymakers make informed decisions about the role bioenergy can play in delivering a low carbon UK energy mix.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Generation of electricity and heat from plant material is listed in the suite of renewable energy technologies that the UK governments think can help deliver 15% of the nations' energy consumption by 2020.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

VAT, or value added tax, jumped from 8% to 15%.\nWithin a few years, the basic rate of tax had fallen to 25%, while the higher rate had been slashed to 40%.\nBy Stephanie FlandersEconomics editor\nWith money from tax cuts in their pockets, shoppers began to rediscover the \"feelgood factor\". They were encouraged further as credit was unleashed.\nRestrictions on hire purchase offers were relaxed, stores offered credit, credit cards boomed. Consumer borrowing tripled during the 1980s.\nAnd, of course, mortgages were easier to get. The old rule of thumb that you only borrow two-and-a-half times salary was thrown out of the window.\nBuilding societies were allowed to lend more and foreign banks set up in the UK to compete.\nThe Bank of England did not control the expansion of credit and there are those who see the roots of the current financial crisis in the credit boom of the Thatcher years.\nMrs Thatcher wanted self-reliance, not reliance on the state. That was the thinking behind the launch of personal pensions in 1988.\nThe new plans provided a route to save for those who did not have a company scheme. But, sadly, they backfired.\nThe promotions and publicity got out of hand. Advisers went to town, encouraging savers to switch out of solid traditional schemes into riskier personal pensions.\nCompensating the victims cost the pensions industry \u00a311bn.\nMore successful were personal equity plans or Peps, designed to encourage savers to salt away up to \u00a36,000 a year in shares, in exchange for a tax break.\nTo complement Peps, John Major, the last chancellor of the Thatcher era, introduced a tax-free vehicle for cash savings, the Tessa.\nThe idea caught on. Peps and Tessas later morphed into individual savings accounts, or Isas, in which Britons have \u00a3390bn salted away.\nBy John Moylan, employment correspondent, BBC News\nFew senior trade union figures have commented on the death of Baroness Thatcher. That silence speaks volumes for the lasting legacy that her reforms had on the power of the movement.\nShe was ushered to power in the wake of the Winter of Discontent when a wave of strikes paralysed many parts of the economy. Rubbish was piled high in the streets as  collections stopped. And famously, gravediggers went on strike.\nThe Conservative government set about a series of changes to employment and trade union laws, which ended mass picketing, secondary action and the closed shop, where staff had to join a union to get a job.\nSecret ballots were introduced, as were restrictions on holding legitimate disputes that still rankle with the unions to this day.\nIn 1979 there were more than 29 million working days lost to strike action. These days, that number is typically well below one million.\nThe miners' strike of 1984-85 came to symbolise the government's battle with the unions. The year-long dispute over pit closures led to repeated scenes of violence as striking miners clashed with police.\nIn the end the miners went back to work. The balance of power in industrial relations had shifted forever.\nUnions insist that the collapse in traditional manufacturing industries during the 1980s did as much to diminish their power. Membership fell from over 12 million in 1980 - today there are fewer than 6 million members of Trades Union Congress-affiliated unions.\nOne of the first actions of the Labour government in 1997 was to repeal the ban on unions at GCHQ - the Government Communications Headquarters - imposed under the Tories. But under New Labour, the main planks of the reforms of the Thatcher years remained unchanged.\nBy Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter, BBC News\nA policy of privatising the UK's large utilities revolutionised share ownership in the UK, and as such it was widely popular with many, though the initiatives also had their critics.\nThe recession of the early 1980s created the environment that allowed the Conservatives to drive forward the idea of moving nationalised industries into private ownership.\nBy the end of its first term, it had already privatised British Aerospace and Cable & Wireless. British Telecom, British Airways, British Steel, as well as water and electricity firms were among those privatised later.\nThis led to a new wave of first-time shareholders in the UK.\nOne of the first privatisations and arguably the most memorable - through a celebrated advertising campaign - was the sell-off of shares in British Gas in 1986.\nThe promotional campaign featured TV adverts in which characters urged each other to \"tell Sid\" about the chance to buy shares at \"affordable\" prices.\nAnyone who has held on to these shares will now have a portfolio that includes a stake in Centrica, BG Group and National Grid.\nPrivatisation was key to the Thatcher government's economic policy. As a result, it hoped that the large subsidies granted to industry over the decades would be eventually phased out, allowing for further tax cuts and controlling borrowing.\nIt also encouraged the idea of members of the public owning shares in big former monopolies.\nYet, figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the percentage of the UK stock market owned by UK individuals was higher in the 1960s and 1970s in terms of value, than the 1980s.\nIn 1981, 28% was owned by UK individuals. This had fallen to 20% by the end of the Thatcher term in 1990. Yet it fell to just over 11% by the end of 2010.\nBy Rebecca Marston, business reporter, BBC News\nThe impact of one of Margaret Thatcher's deregulation drives was the drastic reorganisation of the way shares were traded in the UK.\nThe so-called \"Big Bang\", introduced on 27 October 1986, made it far simpler to trade shares on the London Stock Exchange.\nThe most visible reform was that traders no longer stalked the floor of the Exchange, animatedly dealing with each other face-to-face.\nBig Bang moved them at a stroke from that to screen-based and telephone trading.\nIt also broke up what many saw as a gentlemen's club, ruled by restrictive practices. (It is worth noting that there were almost no women and the gentlemen described came from a far wider class base than the phrase suggests.)\nBefore Big Bang, share dealing was done through a stockbroker, who advised clients on dealings. Transactions were carried out by jobbers, who made markets in shares - physically seeking out others with whom to trade on the Stock Exchange floor.\nPrice competition was not allowed, fixed commissions were the norm.\nAt best it was a self-regulating club, where bounders could easily be spotted, but at its worst this club fostered insider dealing and share price ramping.\nBig Bang saw many of the City's historic names disappear in a frenzy of takeovers as banks jostled to buy  jobbers and stockbrokers in order to become one-stop shops.\nThis, in turn, unleashed a succession of takeovers by even bigger organisations, the giant American finance houses.\nBig Bang helped facilitate privatisation, demystifying the share-buying process that many ordinary people had found a stumbling block, thus allowing people to simply walk into their banks and order a parcel of shares.\nBut while it made dealing and investing easier, it also paved the way for the creation of giant financial institutions, whose size has meant their health is critical to the wellbeing of the general economy.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "During her years as prime minister, Margaret Thatcher revolutionised the economic fortunes of every person in the UK.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

It's in our culture,\" she said.\nIn Vietnam, medical treatment is mostly subsidised by the state via an insurance system free to civil servants and children, or paid for privately or by employers.\nBut queues for treatment under insurance cover are long and public hospitals overcrowded, while salaries for much of the medical profession remain low.\nAnd with growing capitalist sentiment meeting entrenched Confucian values, the practice of handing over a cash-filled envelope to secure faster or better service has become widespread.\nThe number of people who gave envelopes doubled in the three years from 2007-2010 - from 13% to 29%, one study showed.\nIn 2012, a survey published by the World Bank and Vietnam's Government Inspectorate (which runs the Anti-Corruption Bureau) showed that 76% of those who had paid a bribe to health service personnel did so voluntarily, with only 21% responding to a request.\nIn an effort to fight corruption, five big hospitals in Hanoi launched a campaign in October 2011 to bolster ethical behaviour among staff, including a \"Say no to envelopes\" policy.\nVietnam's Research and Training Centre for Community Development (RTCCD) also conducted a similar campaign to change perceptions of informal payments, using the media to raise patients' awareness of their rights as well as of doctors' duties.\nNguyen Huu Ngoc, a well-known scholar in Hanoi, said the root of the problem lay in the Confucian gift-giving tradition.\n\"In Vietnamese society as well as in Chinese, gifts stem from gratitude,\" the scholar said.\n\"Showing gratitude used to have more spiritual value than material value. But over the years, it has become more material and less spiritual, and now in the market economy it is like a transaction.\"\nCulture might be used to justify the payments - but culture can be changed, according to Soren Davidsen, a senior governance specialist at the World Bank in Hanoi.\n\"We know gift-giving is an important part of culture. But we also know that culture is not a static but dynamic thing. Several countries in East Asia, such as Singapore, South Korea and Japan, have a culture of corruption, yet these countries have found effective ways to curb corruption.\n\"Although there is often the perception about culture being a part of corruption, we think that this is the wrong way of looking at it. And we can, by involving people, businesses and government in partnership, actually change culture,\" said Mr Davidsen.\nFor many people, the line between a gift and a bribe has become blurred - something some people embrace as \"an excuse to give envelopes\", said Tran Thu Ha, vice-director of RTCCD.\nBut for people who campaign to stop the practice like her, it is easy to identify what is a gift and what is a bribe.\n\"A gift can be given in public or anywhere, it needs time to talk and to say thank you, whereas a bribe is often given very quickly and both the giver and the receiver are afraid of being seen by other people,\" Ms Ha said.\nBut to change people's behaviour is one of the big difficulties that Vietnam is facing and will take time, acknowledged Mr Ngo Manh Hung, deputy director-general of Vietnam's Anti-Corruption Bureau.\nThere has been considerable debate about how to curb the practice in the health service. One suggestion is raising health workers' salaries so that they stop accepting envelopes.\nBut that alone will not be enough. Associate Professor Ta Van Binh, director of the National Institute of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders, believes that the government needs clear rules and tough punishments for medical staff who break them.\nBut work also needs to be done to help patients understand that they do not need to give envelopes - and may themselves be breaking the rules if they do.\nNguyen Huu Ngoc even thinks that there should be sanctions applied to patients who give envelopes to help clean up the industry.\nBut this would need co-operation from all sides - patients, health workers and the authorities - and remains a big task.\n\"It's not an easy thing to do because corruption is about money, people and power,\" said Mr Davidsen of the World Bank.\n\"It's a huge challenge curbing corruption and co-ordinating anti-corruption efforts across government agencies. It is not a quick fix and can't be done overnight.\"\nThere will be a series of special reports and articles this week as the BBC examines why bribes and backhanders are part of the system in so much of the world, looks at countries which have tried to roll back the tide - and explains how corruption works.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Three months ago, a woman from a village south of Hanoi needed her son referred to a provincial hospital by a district doctor for an operation.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

She was officially the last person born in the 1800s still living.\nShe had attributed her longevity to her genetics and a diet of three eggs a day, two of them raw.\nMs Morano was the oldest of eight siblings, all of whom she has outlived. She died at her home in the northern city of Verbania.\nHer life not only spanned three centuries but also survived an abusive marriage, the loss of her only son, two World Wars and more than 90 Italian governments.\nMs Morano had admitted that her longevity was partly down to genetics: her mother reached 91 and several sisters reached their centenary.\nBut it was also down to a rather unusual diet of three eggs - two raw - each day for more than 90 years.\nIt was a regime she took up as a young woman, after the doctor diagnosed her with anaemia shortly after World War One.\nShe had cut down to just two eggs a day, and a few biscuits recently.\nHer doctor of 27 years, Carlo Bava, had told AFP news agency that she rarely ate vegetables or fruit.\n\"When I met her, she ate three eggs per day, two raw in the morning and then an omelette at noon, and chicken at dinner.\"\nMs Morano also credited her longevity to her decision, in 1938, to kick out her husband - a year after her baby boy died at just six months old.\nThe marriage had never been healthy, she said. She had been in love with a boy who was killed during World War One, and had no interest in marrying someone else.\nBut, she told La Stampa newspaper in an interview when she was a spritely 112 that she was left with little choice.\n\"He told me: 'If you're lucky you marry me, or I'll kill you'. I was 26 years old. I got married.\"\nEventually, it became too much. Though they separated in 1938, they remained married until he died in 1978. Ms Morano, who worked until she was 75, chose never to marry again.\n\"I didn't want to be dominated by anyone,\" she told the New York Times.\nShe had only taken on a full-time carer a couple of years ago - but had not left her small two-room apartment for 20 years.\nAccording to the US-based Gerontology Research Group (GRG), the world's oldest human being is now Jamaican Violet Brown, who was born on March 10, 1900.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "The world's oldest person has died in Italy at the age of 117, reports say.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

And she played with sheer bloody mindedness, in the way she always has.\nThe Stuttgart crowd was respectful of Sharapova, and generous in her moment of victory, although the real warmth was reserved for her opponent.\nThis first win will move the former world number one to the cusp of the top 500, but her ambitions for the week will stretch further, given the way she played and the frailties of some of the top seeds.\nDefeats for both Agnieszka Radwanska and Garbine Muguruza mean Sharapova cannot face a seeded player before the semi-finals. The top players in the women's game remain maddeningly inconsistent, and with Serena Williams pregnant, Victoria Azarenka on maternity leave and Petra Kvitova still recuperating from December's stabbing, there are opportunities galore.\nSharapova is a five-time Grand Slam champion, and a likely future champion. This may be her 15th year on tour, but she has missed more time than most due to shoulder problems, as well as the ban. And rest did Roger Federer no harm before the Australian Open in Melbourne, when he clinched his 18th Grand Slam title after a six-month injury lay-off.\nShe has won Slams on all surfaces and is brimming with motivation on her return from what she considers an unduly harsh ban imposed for an administrative error. And mentally, she is stronger than anyone bar Serena Williams.\nBut it will probably take time. Stringing together seven wins in a row at a Grand Slam is notoriously difficult when you lack match practice and sharpness, and Sharapova may have to negotiate an extra three matches of qualifying at Roland Garros and Wimbledon.\nThis was one of the main themes of her first news conference with regular tennis writers for 15 months. I thought she seemed nervous, quite frosty and was confrontational at times.\n\"I'm not getting a wildcard to receive a trophy or a golden platter,\" she said when asked about the numerous tournament invitations which have upset so many of her peers.\n\"I have to get through the matches and I still have to win them and that's my job.\"\nCaroline Wozniacki and Radwanska are just two players to have questioned why a player returning from a doping ban is being offered so many wildcards. The former world number one and number two were dismissed as \"journeyman\" players by Sharapova's agent Max Eisenbud.\n\"I don't control my manager's words,\" Sharapova said when asked for her response, and then made no attempt to distance herself in the slightest from the sentiments.\n\"I'm sure he's been watching everyone's comments in the previous 15 months and he's entitled to his own opinion.\"\nSharapova's lack of camaraderie has never held her back in the past, and she still has no desire to form friendships on tour. That wouldn't help her tennis, she pointed out. The locker room is where you go for an ice bath, she argued. Her true friends can be found away from the workplace.\nSharapova would love to be at Roland Garros and Wimbledon this year, and she says she would be \"prepared to play in the juniors\" if it helped. She would need to reach the final here in Stuttgart to earn sufficient ranking points to gain direct entry into the qualifying draw of the French Open.\nIf she fails to do so, her fate will be revealed to great fanfare on the evening of Tuesday 16 May, when wildcards for both qualifying and the main draw will be announced on Facebook Live.\nThe All England Club is unlikely to go down the same route.\nOfficially, wildcard recipients will not be determined until Tuesday 20 June, by which time Sharapova could be back in the top 100 and eligible for the main Wimbledon draw. To do so she will need to earn close to 600 ranking points from this week and her next two tournaments in Madrid and Rome.\nA return of one semi-final and one quarter-final is likely to be enough, but that would still be some effort after so long away from the sport.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "From Maria Sharapova's perspective, Wednesday 26 April could not have gone much better.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

An austerity that has ended up disheartening the people\".\nWhen European Union leaders meet on Tuesday he would \"reaffirm that the priority is growth, jobs and investment\", he said.\nMatthew Price, BBC News, Brussels\nEurope has not \"voted against the EU\". The vast majority of those who bothered to cast a ballot did so for parties that are pro-EU, and they will make up the majority in the new parliament.\nYes, the focus is understandably on France and the UK, with Denmark, Greece, and others also giving Euro-enthusiasts cause for concern. However in many countries mainstream parties dominated - in Germany, Italy, Poland where it was felt a growing Eurosceptic movement could break through, in the Netherlands and elsewhere.\nSo the results do not constitute a \"problem\" as such for the leaders of the EU. Many leaders will point this out around the dinner table tonight. Others, however, will stress that a sizeable chunk of voters chose parties that want \"Brussels\" to change, and that the EU needs to address this issue if it is to maintain popular support and legitimacy in the longer term.\nAhead of this election most leaders were not planning to come to Brussels to discuss how to reset their country's relationship with the EU. David Cameron was of course - but others were not. Will others - under domestic pressure - now join him?\nAnti-EU forces overshadow Brussels talks\nMrs Merkel - whose conservative Christian Democratic Union won a comfortable 35% of the vote in Germany - said it was now up to the established parties of Europe to win voters back by focusing on \"improving competitiveness, on growth and creating jobs\".\n\"This is the best answer to the disappointed people who voted in a way we didn't wish for,\" she said.\nElsewhere in Europe, the anti-EU UKIP was celebrating winning 27% of the vote, marking the first time in a century that a party other than the Conservatives or Labour has won any UK election.\nPrime Minister David Cameron, whose Conservative party lost seven seats, said it was clear voters were \"deeply disillusioned\" with Europe and that the message was \"received and understood\".\nBut he insisted he would neither bring forward the date of an in/out referendum on UK withdrawal from the EU - scheduled for 2017 - nor seek a pact with UKIP.\nDespite the unprecedented Eurosceptic gains across the Union, Jose Manuel Barroso, outgoing president of the European Commission, insisted that the pro-EU blocs still had \"a very solid and workable majority\".\nThe centre-right European People's Party appears set to win 213 out of the 751 seats, with 28.36% across the bloc, according to estimated results issued by the European Parliament. That would mean it remains the biggest group - but with more than 60 seats fewer than before.\nThe Socialist alliance has a projected 190 seats, with 25.3% of the vote, the Liberals 9% and the Greens 7%.\nThe Eurosceptic Europe of Freedom and Democracy group appeared to have around 38 seats - including the 24 for UKIP. But the number of non-attached right-wing MEPs is set to rise, boosting the Eurosceptic camp.\nMr Barroso said a \"truly democratic debate\" was needed to address the concerns of those who did not vote, or \"voted in protest\".\nTurnout across Europe is estimated at 43.1%, the first time it has not fallen since the previous election - but it has only increased by 0.1%.\nResult highlights (from European Parliament website):\nThe election is the biggest exercise in multi-national democracy in the world, affecting the lives of the EU's 500 million citizens.\nThe parliament's powers have expanded since the last election in 2009, and it is hoping to have a decisive say in who gets the EU's top job, president of the European Commission.\nYou can follow full coverage with all the latest updates at bbc.co.uk/vote2014.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "French President Francois Hollande has said the EU must reform and scale back its power, amid a surge in support for Eurosceptic and far-right parties.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Although - perhaps ironically - it also caused some mobile phones to switch to French networks in order to function.\nDowning Street said the rise has been driven in part by Britain's economic success relative to its neighbours in the eurozone. Labour said the government's pledge was \"in tatters\".\nBut, unveiling UKIP's campaign advert, Mr Farage said: \"When Cameron made that promise he was being wilfully dishonest.\n\"Because he knew the truth and I think now the British public, five years on, know the truth: that you actually cannot have an immigration policy, you can't set targets of any kind at all, you can't attempt to control who comes into Britain all the while you're members of the European Union.\"\nHe issued a call for a \"return to normality\", saying net immigration - the difference between the number of people leaving the UK and the number coming in - should be brought down to about 30,000 people per year.\nCharlie Elphicke, Conservative candidate in Dover, accused Mr Farage's party of performing U-turns on immigration policy.\n\"All we've seen from UKIP on immigration is chaos and confusion: one minute there's a cap, then there's not. Mark Reckless says certain migrants should be repatriated, then Farage says they're welcome to stay,\" he said.\nI am not sure if it is by design or if he just wants a slow start, but two days in to this general election campaign and UKIP leader Nigel Farage appears to be taking it easy.\nOr at least that is how it seems.\nThis is a candidate who has to win on 7 May. If he fails to become the next MP for South Thanet he has said he will quit as leader.\nYet I have seen no door-knocking.

The party is also said to want to have a say on the wording of the question and the timing of the vote.\nIn response, UKIP's economic spokesman and campaign chief Patrick O'Flynn accused Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg of preparing to \"rig\" a referendum if they are in power together again.\nHe said it would be \"profoundly unfair\" to allow UK-based EU nationals to participate, and claimed the idea to give younger people a vote was designed to sway the result towards an \"in\" vote.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "David Cameron was \"wilfully dishonest\" when he pledged to cap immigration to the tens of thousands, UKIP leader Nigel Farage has said.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Nine players came in, many of Mackay's men left, but it seemed even with so many new faces Solskjaer didn't know what his best team was.\nHe named a different starting 11 for all of the games he oversaw this season and his tinkering was deemed to have had an adverse effect on results.\nTwo home defeats in succession, against Norwich and Middlesbrough, sealed his fate.\nThe nature of the capitulation against the Canaries caused particular concern, Cardiff leading 2-0 before conceding four second-half goals to lose 4-2.\nDuring the 1-0 loss against Boro four days later, the Cardiff crowd vented their frustration at the Norwegian, booing him as he tried to get the ball to one of his players to take a throw-in.\nAfter the game the Norwegian said he accepted the blame for the club's poor run of form.\n\"I'm responsible and I should get better results than we've had in the first seven games,\" said Solskjaer, who seems to have the ability to remain upbeat in the most trying of circumstances.\nThe manager may be responsible for the team but many feel the board, and particularly owner Vincent Tan, have to take some responsibility too.\n\"It was the wrong appointment for Cardiff and the wrong club for Solskjaer,\" said former Cardiff captain Jason Perry on BBC Radio Wales. \"Do we know how Cardiff City play? No.\n\"I think only four players played against Blackburn [in the Championship opener] that played against Middlesbrough. He picked a different back four yet again.\n\"If you're manager or a coach you have a central strategy and you work on that.\"\nSolskjaer will not have the chance to find a strategy that works and attention now turns to the next man to work under Tan.\nEarly favourites include Welshman Tony Pulis, who would be popular with fans given the job he did at Crystal Palace last season, and Dundee's Paul Hartley, who has overseen his club's rise to the Scottish Premiership.\nThings are rarely dull at Cardiff City.

Our family consisted of Mum and Dad, I, Peter, my sister Angela and then our Stephen. I was 10 years old when Stephen was born. Angela was just seven years old.\nOur Dad took us to the hospital, so that we could meet our new baby brother. Mum and Dad said that Angela and I could name him, and we did. Financially, we had little, but our parents, Agnes and Harold, made sure that there was lots of love in our house.\nStephen was such a joy to all of us. Mum and Dad only received good reports from Stephen's school regarding his conduct and application to his lessons.\nProfiles of all those who died\nStephen's personality was such that people warmed to him instantly as he had an easy way with him. He was popular with teachers and made friends, having the ability to also keep friends. The friends that he made when he was small were still his close friends when he died on that awful day.\nWhen we moved from Garston to our new house in Speke, Stephen had no problems adapting to the new environment, getting to know our new neighbours and making friends in an effortless and  uncomplicated way.\nI started work at 17. There was a shop in Garston called Smiths that sold everything. It's gone now. I bought Stephen a train set when I got paid. He was about nine at the time and wanted one.\nAs Angela and I were so much older than him, we kind of spoilt him, as he was such a lovable kid. I remember us both setting up the train set together and the joy Stephen got playing with it.\nHe was so careful about his toys. When he finished playing with the train set, he would put it away neatly. He minded his toys.\nHe used to follow Angela everywhere, even if she was going out to meet friends he would follow her and she would complain to Mum and Dad about having to bring 11 him.\nHowever, one day someone told Angela that there was an accident on the road and that Stephen was hurt. Angela ran down the cinder path near our home towards the school crying.\nWhen she got there, she was told he had not waited for the lollipop lady and got a bump from a car. He was physically fine, but Angela was sobbing and so distressed at the thought that Stephen was hurt.\nAngela was so good to Stephen and minded him throughout his childhood. All her friends knew him well because he was like her shadow.\nStephen started to take an interest in birds when he was about 12 years old. He started to study them and could tell you the name of most birds as well as their  eggs. It was also around this time that he became interested in fishing.\nWe had cousins that were avid fishermen and they took him along to Speke Hall, which is a rural setting in a National Trust estate right in the middle of Liverpool. He just loved fishing there and knew all about the fish that lived in the waters there.\nHe seldom, if ever, brought fish home to Mum and Dad. It was a joke in our house about Stephen catching fish, but he preferred to put the fish back into the water.\nWe think it was the birds and the fishing that started Stephen wanted to work out of doors. He appreciated being outdoors.\nHe finished school at 16 years of age and studied for his City and Guilds in Botany and Horticulture. He could name any flower and plant and was perfectly at home with nature.\nHe applied for and got a job with the Liverpool Parks and Gardens based in Calderstones Park. He treasured his job and became a gardener at Sudley Hall in Mossley Hill.\nHe loved his work, the people he worked with, he enjoyed meeting all the visitors and telling them about the gardens.\nWhen Stephen was about 15 years old, he met his girlfriend Jackie. They were very much in love and were engaged to be married when he died.\nStephen knew what he wanted from life. He was very close to our Mum and his main ambition in life was to save enough money to buy our parents a house. He did not want them living in rented accommodation.\nHe was mature and sensible for his age. He took out insurance policies in case anything happened to him, as he wanted our parents to have some money.\nHe was very caring to his nieces and nephews. When Angela's marriage broke down and she was on her own with her two children, Sean and Carla, Stephen with his  girlfriend Jackie would babysit and play with the children, keeping them amused for hours.\nHe could have been out with his mates but knew that Angela needed time alone and his family always came first with him.\nStephen, of course, loved football. His love of football and of Liverpool came from our Dad. The whole family travelled around to watch the matches, but not since 1989.\nAfter 1989, we gave the season tickets back and we never went to a football match again.\nStephen loved to play football as well. He was not the best of players, but he was like an encyclopaedia when it came to anything about football generally.\nStephen was a great music fan. He was always playing Pink Floyd and, in particular, 'Shine on you Crazy Diamond'. He always loved Marillion and went to concerts with his four close friends.\nOur parents never got over Stephen's death and the way he died. Our brother Stephen was one of life's genuine nice guys.\nOur Stephen was just 20 years of age, but had maturity and a caring attitude towards others and even from a young age carried a donor card.\nWe miss Stephen from our family and think about what might have been for all of us as a family if Stephen had not died on that awful day.

It was the brainchild of his son Ji Lee, a 45-year-old creative director at Facebook, which owns Instagram.\nThe family emigrated to Sao Paulo from Seoul in 1981.\nBut Ji Lee and his wife eventually relocated to New York while his sister and her husband made the decision to return to Korea with their two sons, who were the centre of Chan Jae's world.\n\"My father was retired and spending time with my nephews, like driving them to school, was a huge part of his day. After they left, he had nothing to do and that scared my mother and me,\" said Mr Lee.\n\"We were very worried that he would age quickly without having anything to do and would become depressed.\"\nIt took him months to convince his \"quiet reserved\" father who \"hated learning new things\" that he should draw for his grandchildren, as he had for his children, and post the pictures online to stay in touch.\n\"He hated the idea and just could not grasp the concept. He didn't understand the purpose of why we wanted to share his art on Instagram but I was determined to teach him,\" he told BBC News from his home in New York.\n\"But I sat down with him every day and at dinner one night, we had a conversation about drawing for my son. That was the turning point and eventually he became more receptive to learn.\"\n\"Capturing his style of drawing\" was another big struggle he faced.\n\"Now he uses different editing tools and can even understands hashtags so that was revolutionary.\"\n\"This Instagram account really changed my father's life. Since then, he's been making one drawing a day. My mother writes the stories and my father brings them to life.\"\nDinosaurs, pandas, superheroes and nature are all common themes in Chan Jae's work for his grandchildren.\nThe daily life and culture of Korea also feature prominently.\nMore importantly, each post teaches a lesson, shares a memory or even carries a personal message. They are translated into three languages: English, Korean and Portuguese.\n\"Your grandma is a super woman. She's carrying a baby in front and another on her back. Children, please don't forget,\" read one heart-warming post.\nTo take things a step further, Ji Lee told his father's story through a video on Facebook which went viral, gathering more than 18,000 reactions and 1.3m views on the site.\nHe said he was shocked by how popular his video had become.\n\"I went to bed and when I woke up, it had gone viral. The Instagram account has also grown and he now has more than 40,000 followers.\"\nThousands of users on Facebook wrote about how Chan Jae's story touched them.\n\"This is amazing on so many levels. A modern living legacy. Your brilliance has so much depth,\" said Valerie LaMastro.\nOthers like David Harvey shared similar experiences with getting elderly people to make use of technology.\n\"That's a wonderful story. Beautiful drawings and a beautiful job telling the story, too. My father also had little to no interest in technology until texting and now it has brought us much closer together.\"\nDevrin Carlson-Smith said: \"I was one of the first to follow 'Drawings for my Grandchildren' and told you the story of how I got my mum into Instagram. I love that your dad is back into his art. I hope to do that too so I don't lose my skills.\"\nTo Ji Lee, the most rewarding part of this all was helping others around the world.\n\"So many people are sharing my video and interacting with it.

As global incomes rise, demand for these products is set to soar. This in turn will spark a rise in demand grass crops and production is expected to increase by 80% by 2050.\nBut the study points out that at present, the vast majority of grasslands in the world are losing more phosphorus than they are gaining.\nThe losses are mainly caused by farmers collecting manure from grasslands and using it to fertilise croplands. The amount being lost from intensive farming is far greater than from pastoral systems. Between 1970 and 2005, 44% of these losses occurred in Asia.\n\"This is one main factor,\" said Prof Martin van Ittersum, a co-author of the study from the University of Wageningen in the Netherlands.\n\"Of all the manure that is deposited on the grassland, half of it is taken away for croplands or used for fuel or for plastering the walls of the houses in Africa.  The fact is that the grasslands are not fertilised, so you have very little inputs to the system.\"\nThe researchers say that to meet the projected demand for grassland in 2050, the amounts of phosphorus used will have to grow more than fourfold from 2005 levels.\nTo cope with both grassland and arable land demands, the overall use of mineral phosphorus fertiliser must double by the middle of the century.\n\"It is a vast area but that is very significant, yes,\" said Prof van Ittersum.\n\"It is our strong assumption, that productivity will decrease and the pressure on our feed crops will increase and that is something that we should avoid,\" he said.\n\"There is already a societal concern that we are feeding too much of our cereal crops to livestock and that pressure will only increase if our grasslands decrease in productivity.\"\nBut increasing the amount of phosphorus used on land, especially in mineral form, carries significant environmental concerns.\nExcessive use of fertilisers of all types can lead to a leaching of nutrients into the sea where they have created so-called \"dead zones\".\n\"A fourfold rise in phosphorus use would have a big impact on the environment, especially on marine life,\" said Marissa de Boer who is European Project Manager of SusPhos at VU University in Amsterdam.\n\"The leaching of phosphorus from agricultural lands into rivers and eventually the sea leads to uncontrolled algae growth and dead zones such as the ones found in the Baltic Sea, Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico. This is an effect of increased fertilizer use in the past half century.\nWhat would the effect be if we now increase phosphorus use fourfold?\"\nProf van Ittersum says these issues can be controlled. The most important thing is awareness.\n\"We are still talking about modest amounts, I don't think the environmental risks are particularly big,\" he told BBC News.\n\"We have to do it carefully, we have to reuse our residues and wastes and make sure as little phosphorus as possible ends up in our sewage systems.\"\nThe study has been published in the journal, Nature Communications.\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc and on Facebook.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "The world must significantly increase its use of phosphorus-based fertiliser to meet future demands for food.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

These things are never made public.\nRemoving Strachan and his coaches and finding replacements would have meant a serious hit to the coffers of an association that has routinely failed to benefit from the millions of euros on offer to those nations who qualify for major championships.\nMoney was not brought up in the statement, but it's inconceivable that it didn't play a part in the discussion.\nWhy pay when the World Cup campaign is already on life support? Why not accept your fate of another doomed mission, let him see out of his deal, save the cash and make a change if one needs to be made when the group fixtures are completed?\nThe SFA couldn't say any of this. It couldn't say it was unwilling, or unable, to pay off the manager, so a different narrative was delivered in its statement, a narrative of \"jam tomorrow\". In this optimistic view of the world, all that was missing was a complimentary pair of pom-poms.\nAll hope of a play-off spot for the World Cup is not lost, they say. They're clinging to the belief that Scotland can garner enough points from a remaining available total of 18 to force their way into the reckoning when the evidence of everybody's eyes tell us otherwise.\nPresenting a scenario of Scotland reeling off win after win required a fair amount of chutzpah for an association that has watched its team concede seven goals in three winless games. And that on top of two years without a competitive win against anybody other than Malta and Gibraltar.\nStewart Regan, the SFA's chief executive, is quoted on how adamant Strachan is about his team's capacity to make up ground in the group. How? He doesn't say.\nRegan points out that the board is convinced that Strachan still has the \"hunger for the challenge\". Hunger shouldn't have anything to do with it when you've failed to qualify for the most easily accessible Euros in history and then sit fifth out of six in a World Cup qualification group with your dreams going up in a puff of smoke.\nScotland will limp on now until March, when they host Slovenia at Hampden. Will we hear again that Slovenia is not a must-win? Will we see anything different?\nWill any new players be considered? Will there be any thoughts about a new formation? Is there likely to be any acknowledgement that, if Scotland keep doing the same things, they are going to end up with the same results?\nThere was no hint of that in Strachan's words in the SFA statement on Thursday. No acceptance that, if he's staying on, he needs to have a major think about what he is doing, who's he selecting and not selecting.\nIf he had spoken about a new beginning then you might - might - be inclined to buy into it. Is he even thinking about it that way? You would hope so, but it's unlikely.\nThere is so much to ponder. Does Scotland have to follow a slavish adherence to 4-2-3-1? Can a solution be found to the absence of dominant centre-backs by converting a full-back or a midfielder? Maybe not, but where are the ideas?\nWe saw a snapshot of Strachan's out-of-the-box thinking when he played Ikechi Anya at right-back at Wembley. What happens when Kieran Tierney and Andrew Robertson are both fit at left-back, along with Lee Wallace and Stephen Kingsley? Is it really one from four there? Does it have to be that way? Where's the innovation, the sense of a manager trying something a bit different?\nAnd what about an enhanced cast of characters on the scene? Aberdeen's Graeme Shinnie, Fulham's Tom Cairney, Brighton's Jamie Murphy, Aston Villa's Ross McCormack, Stoke City's Phil Bardsley and, yes, if he ever starts playing and scoring again, Middlesbrough's Jordan Rhodes.\nThere are others, either on the periphery of the squad or totally divorced from it, that could be looked at properly. Too often, Strachan has been rigid in his thinking and it's done nothing for the team.\nThe tired mantra that \"the players are just not there\" is an entirely bogus argument when all that is being asked is that Scotland become truly competitive, like Northern Ireland. They have decent Premier League centre-halves - from West Brom, who sit 11th - and an impressive midfielder from Southampton - who are 10th - but who have precious little else in terms of quality and, most especially, depth.\nAnd yet, from a squad largely made up of Championship, League One and Scottish Premiership players, Northern Ireland get the kind of results that are beyond Scotland.\nThe attitude of \"no manager could do better with these players\" is fatalism. It's tantamount to a white flag being raised. A quitter's charter, the central tenet of which is blown to the high heavens by what Michael O'Neill is doing with his meagre resources in Belfast.\nThe SFA's statement on Thursday did nothing to challenge the view that a blind faith - or a meek acceptance of failure -  has taken an ever firmer hold of Hampden. When they can't get a draw against Georgia, can't beat Lithuania and can't avoid a drubbing against a moderate team like Slovakia, the idea of Scotland suddenly morphing into a points machine is a hard sell.\nScotland took the most affordable option, but a dwindling number of supporters would agree that it was the best one.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "In the Scottish Football Association's statement of Thursday evening, there is no mention of money and the kind of cash it would have taken to bring to an end the reign of Gordon Strachan as national team manager.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The researchers based their estimates on trees currently growing in trial plots in Egypt and in the Negev desert.\n\"The results are overwhelming,\" said Prof Klaus Becker, from the University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart.\n\"There was good growth, a good response from these plants. I feel there will be no problem trying it on a much larger scale, for example ten thousand hectares in the beginning,\" he said.\nAccording to the researchers a plantation that would cover three percent of the Arabian desert would absorb all the CO2 produced by cars and trucks in Germany over a 20 year period.\nThe scientists say that a critical element of the plan would be the availability of desalination facilities. This means that initially, any plantations would be confined to coastal areas.\nThey are hoping to develop larger trials in desert areas of Oman or Qatar. Prof Becker says that unlike other schemes that just offset the carbon that people produce, the planting of jatropha could be a good,  short term solution to climate change.\n\"I think it is a good idea because we are really extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - and it is completely different between extracting and preventing.\"\nAccording to the scientist's calculations the costs of curbing carbon dioxide via the planting of trees would be between 42 and 63 euros per tonne. This makes it competitive with other techniques, such as the more high tech carbon capture and storage (CCS).\nA number of countries are currently trialling this technology but it has yet to be deployed commercially.\nGrowing jatropha not only soaks up CO2 but has other benefits. The plants would help to make desert areas more habitable, and the plant's seeds can be harvested for biofuel say the researchers, providing an economic return.\n\"Jatropha is ideal to be turned into biokerosene - it is even better than biodiesel,\" said Prof Becker.\nBut other experts in this area are not convinced. They point to the fact that in 2007 and 2008 large numbers of jatropha trees were planted for biofuel, especially in Africa. But many of these ventures ended in tears, as the plants were not very successful in coping with dry conditions.\nLucy Hurn is the biofuels campaign manager for the charity, Actionaid. She says that while jatropha was once seen as the great, green hope the reality was very different.\n\"When jatropha was introduced it was seen as a miracle crop, it would grow on scrubland or marginal land,\" she said.\n\"But there are often people who need marginal land to graze their animals, they are getting food from that area - we wouldn't class the land as marginal.\"\nShe pointed out that jatropha is highly toxic and can pollute the land it is grown on, even in a desert. And she also had concerns about the fairness of the idea.\n\"It is still somebody else's land. Why go in and grow these massive plantations to deal with a problem these people didn't actually cause?\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Scientists say that planting large numbers of jatropha trees in desert areas could be an effective way of curbing emissions of CO2.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Sometimes I try things and it doesn't work and I've broken my ribs, my hand, dislocated shoulders in the gym but we get it right for the fight.\n\"One of the main things is his mindset at the minute. He claims he is obsessed and I ask 'What is he obsessed about?' I look at myself in the mirror and it is about beating me.\n\"I've lived simple. I've been training under the dark light so I can shine under the bright lights on April 29.\"\nJoshua had numerous incidents with the police as a youth, including being arrested for ABH, drug possession and being electronically tagged. He has previously stated that he would have been in jail were it not for boxing.\nBut Joshua said: \"I've had tougher times in the gym than I have had in any walk of life at the minute.\n\"I put myself through it and it is important to because I don't want to be star of the gym and then when I get to the fight it's like: 'I've never faced this type of warrior before.'\"\nAsked if this is the defining fight of his career, Joshua replied: \"It is one of them. If this was towards the end of my career, I would say: 'This is the defining fight that's going to write the history books.'\n\"But I've still got so many more years. I'm confident. I'm learning about myself, so this fight is, for me, one fight that I've got to take in my stride round by round and when I take that attitude the victory comes and we move on and there are so many other big fights in the UK.\"\nJoshua does not believe Klitschko has underestimated him, saying: \"He's coming game, he's coming ready, and the body does what the mind tells it. His mind seems to be in the right place so I'm in for a tough fight.\"\n\"I may not express myself flashing what I've done and telling everyone I'm the greatest,\" he said.\n\"Where we grew up, everyone was about making money, but low key, understated - you probably didn't want to get your house burgled!\n\"Who I am when I was 17 is who I am today, so not much has changed.\n\"You've got to add a bit of flavour. It's needed now and again, but it's got to be real because I don't take boxing as an act. This is way of expressing myself and being true to myself and there are kids watching so you've got to be mindful.\n\"If I was to be that type of person - loud and trashing tables - after a fight, I would still continue to be that way.

It is good to lock yourself away but I'm a man of the people, it's no bother. As long as it doesn't make me late for training, I've no problem speaking to 100 people.\n\"I'm in the same flat that I've been in since 2011 - it's been a long time. I think I'll be one of those guys who will learn the piano, the violin, bungee jump and do all the things I didn't do when I was fighting.\n\"When I'm not fighting, I try to take a holiday and experience things, but when I'm fighting the simple life has worked and I don't try and change it.\"\n\"I was on the complete opposite end of healthy living before boxing, it's got me strong,\" he said.\n\"I'm a superhero to my little cousins.

But somehow, the emperors find a way up to breed, and also to come and go as they forage for the seafood that will sustain their chicks.\n\"We thought that in years when the sea ice was bad, they just didn't breed, but they're clearly more adaptable than that,\" said lead author Peter Fretwell from the British Antarctic Survey.\nThe emperor is the most southerly of the Antarctic penguin species and the only one to breed on sea ice in the southern winter.\nTheir reliance on these thin seasonal marine floes as a reproductive platform, coupled with concern about how the patterns of Antarctic sea ice could change in a warming world, has led to the species being designated as \"near threatened\" on the IUCN red list.\nCurrently, the extent of winter sea ice in the Antarctic is growing year by year, albeit slowly.\nThe coverage does however vary considerably by region, and climate computer models indicate any gains will very likely be reversed later this century.\nBut this study on four colonies around the continent suggests emperors do have the capacity to meet and beat some of the challenges that may lie ahead.\nIn the observations of Shackleton Ice Shelf in East Antarctica, for example, the penguins are seen to be very adept at finding the routes that allow them to get past a 30m-high cliff.\n\"When they go out from the colony to forage, they go down the steep cliff - the shortest route to the sea. We're not sure how they get down - they may slide down or jump down,\" Mr Fretwell told BBC News.\n\"But this cliff is too steep for them to climb back up and so they must return a different way, likely through an ice creek. This route is 5km longer and we know they take it because we can see their tracks in the satellite pictures.\"\nThere is a big opportunity here to go study these penguins which have yet to be visited by an expedition.\nThere is obviously some cost to going up on the ice shelves - they are windier and the birds must travel further to forage. If that cost was not there, they would habitually breed on the shelves rather than the temperamental thin floes.  But how big this cost is and how beneficial is the observed adaptation in years of poor sea ice has yet to be properly established.\nCo-author Barbara Wienecke from the Australian Antarctic Division said: \"These new findings are an important step forward in helping us understand what the future may hold for these animals. However, we cannot assume that this behaviour is widespread in other penguin populations.\n\"The ability of these four colonies to relocate to a different environment - from sea ice to ice shelf - in order to cope with local circumstances, was totally unexpected.\n\"We have yet to discover whether or not other species may also be adapting to changing environmental conditions.\"\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Emperor penguins have displayed some unexpected breeding behaviour in the Antarctic that could mean they are much more resilient to environmental change than previously recognised.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

His family say he will not appeal.\nThe parents of Reeva Steenkamp told the BBC they were happy with the sentence and relieved the case was over.\nProsecutors had called for a minimum 10-year term, and the defence had argued for community service and house arrest.\nPistorius, 27, an amputee sprinter who became the first athlete to compete in the Olympic and Paralympic Games, killed Ms Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year.\nHe says he shot her by mistake, fearing there was an intruder in his house in Pretoria.\nMs Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model, reality TV star and law graduate, was hit three times by bullets fired by Pistorius through a toilet door.\nBefore he went down the stairs and out of court, Oscar Pistorius slipped off his expensive watch and handed it to a relative. It seems the athlete probably knew his sentence beforehand, which helps explains the subdued atmosphere in court today.\nThis case has revealed plenty about South Africa - its gun culture, the strengths and inadequacies of its police and prisons. But above all it has been a simple story, about the rise and fall of a global icon.\nAs the crowds and cameras drift away from the courthouse, what lingers is the sense of waste. Of lives and careers for sure. But of time too.\nA man and a woman went into a bathroom. Only one came out alive. As the judge made clear - the trial should have been over in a matter of weeks. Instead it turned into a tortuous, overwrought epic.\nRelief as justice is served\nPistorius showed little reaction to the sentence other than to wipe his eyes before being led away to a holding cell downstairs.\nHe was then driven away from court in an armoured police van to Pretoria's Kgosi Mampuru prison, where he was expected to undergo a medical assessment.\nIt is likely that he will be held in a one-man cell in the hospital wing, thought to be most appropriate for the athlete's disability.\nCorrectional services spokesman Manelisi Wolela told AFP news agency Pistorius was \"already accommodated at Kgosi Mampuru\".\nHe could be released after serving a sixth of his sentence, or 10 months, for good behaviour.\nHowever, Dup De Bruyn, a lawyer for the Steenkamp family, told Reuters that he believed Pistorius would probably serve two years.\nPistorius's uncle, Arnold, said the family would not appeal against the sentence.\n\"We accept the judgment. Oscar will embrace the opportunity to pay back to society,\" he said.\nHe appealed to the media to \"accept the ruling of court and let us move forward in this process and give us some degree of dignity and privacy\".\nThe BBC's Nomsa Maseko, outside court, says opinion there was divided on the sentence, with some saying it was too light, others that it was fair.\nJudge Masipa said she considered her sentence \"fair and just, both to society and to the accused\".\nShe said: \"A non-custodial sentence would send the wrong message to the community. On the other hand, a long sentence would also not be appropriate either, as it would lack the element of mercy.\"\nShe said Pistorius had made an \"enormous contribution to society\", in his charity work and in changing the public perception of disability.\nBut she added: \"It would be a sad day for this country if an impression were to be created that there was one law for the poor and disadvantaged, and another for the rich and famous.\"\nJudge Masipa also gave Pistorius a three-year suspended sentence for a separate incident - firing a gun in a restaurant.\nThe prosecution service said it would consider an appeal but expressed satisfaction that Pistorius had been given jail time.\nHowever, the Women's League of South Africa's ruling African National Congress said it did plan to appeal.\n\"We're doing this not only for Reeva but for the millions of South African women who are killed at the hands of their partners, people who are supposed to protect them,\" said spokeswoman Khsuela Sangoni.\n\"A five-year sentence like this sends a message to society that it is fine to commit such heinous crimes as femicide, and you will be able to get away with a slap on the wrist.\"\nThe International Paralympic Committee told the BBC it would not allow Pistorius to run at any of its events for five years, even if he were released early.\nInside Oscar Pistorius's home\n1\n2\n3\n5\n4\nMr Pistorius said he and Ms Steenkamp had dinner at about 19:00 before going to bed at 21:00. He said he woke in the early hours, spoke briefly to his girlfriend and got up to close the sliding door and curtains.\nJudge Thokozile Masipa questioned the reliability of several witnesses who said they heard screams and gunshots between about 03:12 and 03:17, saying most had 'got facts wrong'.\nMr Pistorius said he heard the bathroom window sliding open and believed that an intruder, or intruders, had entered the bathroom through a window which was not fitted with burglar bars.\nMr Pistorius said he grabbed his firearm and told Ms Steenkamp, who he thought was still in bed, to call the police.\nThe judge said it made no sense that Ms Steenkamp did not hear him scream 'Get out' or call the police, as she had her mobile phone with her.\nMr Pistorius could see the bathroom window was open and toilet door closed. He said he did not know whether the intruders were outside on a ladder or in the toilet.\nHe had his firearm in front of him, he heard a movement inside the toilet and thought whoever was inside was coming out to attack him.\n'Before I knew it, I had fired four shots at the door,' he said.\nThe judge said she did not accept that Mr Pistorius fired the gun by accident or before he knew what was happening. She said he had armed himself with a lethal weapon and clearly wanted to use it. The other question, she said, was why he fired not one, but four shots before he ran back to the room to try to find Ms Steenkamp.\nMr Pistorius said he went back to the bedroom and noticed that Ms Steenkamp was not there.\nMr Pistorius said this was when he realised she could have been in the toilet and rushed back to the bathroom.\nMr Pistorius said he screamed for help and went back to the bathroom where he found the toilet was locked. He returned to the bedroom, pulled on his prosthetic legs and turned on the lights before bashing in the toilet door with a cricket bat.\nWhen the door panel broke, he found the key and unlocked the door and found Ms Steenkamp slumped on the floor with her head on the toilet bowl.

Ideally all four at once.\nFirst up, flexing his muscles, and jabbing hard, was Senator Rand Paul on whether Trump had the character to have his hand on the nuclear trigger.\n\"I'm very concerned about him - having him in charge of the nuclear weapons, because I think his response, his - his visceral response to attack people on their appearance - short, tall, fat, ugly - my goodness, that happened in junior high. Are we not way above that?\"\nGood shot, Rand, but thwack came the response - \"I never attacked him on his look, and believe me, there's plenty of subject matter right there,\" said Trump.\nCue laughter. Next up into the ring was Wisconsin governor Scott Walker. \"Mr Trump. We don't need an apprentice in the White House.\" But with a squint of those blue eyes, Trump shot back \"in Wisconsin, you're losing $2.2bn right now. I would do so much better than that.\"\nJake Tapper, the excellent CNN host, didn't quite say \"roll up, roll up who else wants to take their chances against my boy?\" But he didn't need to. They were lining up.\nHold on a minute. What's this? My, my, a lady is getting into the ring. Surely she wouldn't be able to draw blood where everyone else had failed. Well she did.\nThe former Hewlett Packard boss Carly Fiorina had been roundly insulted by Trump when he questioned her suitability because of her appearance.\nHe told Rolling Stone  - \"Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?\"\nShe was stoic and measured: \"I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr Trump said.\" And Trump was now visibly back-pedalling. \"I think she's got a beautiful face, and I think she's a beautiful woman.\"\nHer face was acid. She did not flinch. It was a gotcha moment.\nAnd \"low energy\" Jeb Bush - as Donald Trump dubbed him -  achieved something similar when he gave a Trump a good kicking over the tycoon bringing Bush's Mexican-born wife into the political debate.\nTrump looked defensive. He wouldn't give the apology that Bush demanded, but he was discomfited.\nThere was a lot of serious stuff in this sprawling three hour debate. But if you're in a fairground - well you want all the fun of the fair. And once again Donald Trump provided it.  He is still the focal point.

Galaxies appear to rotate faster at their edges than the matter we see can account for, and one set of candidates for this missing dark matter is supersymmetric particles.\nHowever, researchers at the LHCb detector have dealt a serious blow to hopes of finding them.\nThey have measured the decay between a particle known as a Bs meson into two particles known as muons. It is the first time that this decay has ever been observed, and the team has calculated that for every billion times that the Bs meson decays it only decays in this way three times.\nIf superparticles were to exist, the decay would happen far more often. This experiment is one of the \"golden\" tests for supersymmetry, and it would appear that this hugely popular theory among physicists has failed.\nThe result is at a statistical level of \"3.5 sigma\" - meaning that there is a one-in-4300 chance that the team would see the same \"bump\" in their data if the decay were not happening. This level makes the find worth further investigation, but falls well short of the 5-sigma level of certainty required for a formal discovery.\nProf Val Gibson, leader of the Cambridge University LHCb team, said that the new result was \"putting our supersymmetry theory colleagues in a spin\".\nThe results are in fact completely in line with what one would expect from the Standard Model. There is already concern that the LHCb's sister detectors might have expected to have detected superparticles by now, yet none has been found so far.\nIf supersymmetry is not an explanation for dark matter, then theorists will have to find alternative ideas to explain those inconsistencies in the Standard Model. So far researchers who are racing to find evidence of so called \"new physics\" have run into a series of dead ends.\n\"If new physics exists, then it is hiding very well behind the Standard Model,\" commented Cambridge physicist Dr Marc-Olivier Bettler, a member of the analysis team.\nThe result does not rule out the possibility that super particles exist. But according to Prof Parkes, \"they are running out of places to hide\".\nSupporters of supersymmetry, however, such as Prof John Ellis of King's College London, said that the observation is \"quite consistent with supersymmetry\".\n\"In fact,\" he said, \"(it) was actually expected in (some) supersymmetric models.  I certainly won't lose any sleep over the result.\"\n\u2022 The Standard Model is the simplest set of ingredients - elementary particles - needed to make up the world we see in the heavens and in the laboratory\n\u2022 Quarks combine together to make, for example, the proton and neutron - which make up the nuclei of atoms today - though more exotic combinations were around in the Universe's early days\n\u2022 Leptons come in charged and uncharged versions; electrons - the most familiar charged lepton - together with quarks make up all the matter we can see; the uncharged leptons are neutrinos, which rarely interact with matter\n\u2022 The \"force carriers\" are particles whose movements are observed as familiar forces such as those behind electricity and light (electromagnetism) and radioactive decay (the weak nuclear force)\n\u2022 The Higgs boson came about because although the Standard Model holds together neatly, nothing requires the particles to have mass; for a fuller theory, the Higgs - or something else - must fill in that gap\nFollow Pallab on Twitter\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Researchers at the Large Hadron Collider have detected one of the rarest particle decays seen in nature.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

It was a night to celebrate the courage and fighting spirit of the contestants. We all won that night.\"\nShe says that her \"rich and challenging\" life has taken another positive turn after winning the contest.\n\"Polio made me wheelchair-bound early on in life but I never saw it as a disability and worked hard to be trained as a media professional like other normal people in the country.\n\"And winning the pageant is just another way of showing that disability cannot stop you from feeling and looking beautiful,\" the 41-year-old says.\nDivya Arora feels her first runner-up crown has strengthened her belief that \"beauty is boundless\".\nMs Arora, who earlier worked for a leading newspaper, says her faith that \"disability can never overshadow her beauty and abilities\" helped her do well in the pageant.\nThe contest is the idea of tax consultant Sounak Banerjee whose life changed in 2006 when muscular dystrophy forced him to use a wheelchair to get around in the bustling city of Mumbai.\nMr Banerjee liked watching Bollywood films and TV shows but often found the absence of people with disabilities in the entertainment industry \"disturbing\".\n\"Disabled people are also consumers of the entertainment industry but they are seldom represented,\" he says.\nHe then came up with the idea of the Miss Wheelchair India contest to fill the gap and provide a platform they could call their own.\nPlanning the event was tough due to a lack of funding and human resources, he says but adds that the struggles were forgotten when the final day approached.\n\"I felt satisfied and happy when I saw these women wearing their best costumes and a winning smile. It all came together nicely in the end - I had done something for these courageous contestants,\" he says.\n\"I found the contest very unique because it honoured beauty irrespective of contestants' physical disabilities,\" says scientist Gopika Anand, 31, who won the second runner-up crown.\nMs Anand met with a road accident while studying engineering and was soon confined to a wheelchair. But she persevered, completed her course and found work as a scientist at a leading consumer manufacturing firm.\nShelly Bhutani, another contestant, hopes that the corporate world will take notice of the event in the future.\n\"I feel we too deserve to be in front of the camera and get brand endorsements like Miss India winners,\" she says.\nMs Arora, however, felt the organisers were not well prepared for the event and did not provide the kind of support she had hoped for.\nMr Banerjee accepts that a lack of sponsorship made the job of organising the event tough.\n\"I agree that there were problems at the event. We will work harder and hope that more people will support the event next year,\" he says.\nBut other contestants want to see change at a more basic level.\nIndia is not known to be a disabled-friendly country as most public places, monuments and buildings do not have facilities catering to their specific needs.\nBhavna Sharma, who won the contest in a category that honoured people who are disabled but not necessarily confined to a wheelchair, says citizens with disabilities do not feel inferior and have achieved success in almost every field.\n\"But it's the country's poor infrastructure for disabled people that lets us down,\" the 27-year-old says.\nSome years ago Neenu Kewlani travelled all over India in a chauffer-driven car to highlight the problems faced by those with physical challenges while commuting.\nShe says the problem is even more severe in rural areas and smaller towns where people with disabilities are virtually confined to their homes. Nearly every contestant expressed concern over a lack of sensitivity about disability rights.\nBut not one of them is willing to give up hope.\nMs Kewlani says there is a long way to go in making India a disabled-friendly country but \"we are not ready to give up as we are fighters\".\n\"Facilities are improving in cities but we will continue to put pressure on governments to ensure they provide better opportunities and infrastructure for the disabled,\" she adds.\nCalcutta-based Sarmistha Sinha says disability rights activists will have to continue fighting like other marginalised sections of the society.\nAn accident in 2006 confined the 41-year-old doctor to a wheelchair, but she says her \"thoughts and ability to stay positive remained free\".\nMs Sinha won in a category which honoured married women in a wheelchair. But winning was not everything for her as she wanted to use the platform to showcase her talent.\nThe wheelchair dancer saw the contest as an opportunity to present her skills and meet people like herself from all over the country. \"I only wanted to dance as such opportunities are rare but the feeling that I have won a beauty pageant is slowly sinking in,\" she adds.\nFor Gopika Anand the real winning moment came when she saw her father's moist eyes as the results were announced.\n\"I was overwhelmed to see her with the crown. I am very proud today to be recognised as Gopika Anand's father,\" says Anand Mohan.\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

We gave Bin Laden his jihad.\"\nLady Manningham-Buller said MI5 was given a budget increase after 9/11 and again in 2002 but the agency still needed far greater resources as a result of the Iraq invasion.\n\"By 2003 I found it necessary to ask the prime minister for a doubling of our budget,\" she said. \"This is unheard of, certainly unheard of today, but he and the Treasury and the chancellor accepted that, because I was able to demonstrate the scale of the problem that we were confronted by.\"\nBaroness Manningham-Buller was part of the government's Joint Intelligence Committee before the war, which drew up the controversial dossier on Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction in September 2002. The dossier stated the weapons could be activated with 45 minutes of an order to do so.\nAsked about the dossier, she said she had very limited involvement in its compilation but it was clear, with hindsight, that there was an \"over-reliance\" on certain intelligence.\nShe added: \"We were asked to put in some low-grade, small intelligence into it and we refused because we did not think that it was reliable.\"\nShe said MI5's responsibility was to collect and analyse intelligence and to \"act on it where necessary\" to mitigate terrorist threats, but stressed it was not her job \"to fill in gaps\" in the intelligence.\nA year before the war, the former MI5 chief advised Home Office officials that the direct threat posed by Iraq to the UK was \"very limited and containable\".\nIn a newly declassified document, published by the inquiry, Baroness Manningham-Buller told the senior civil servant at the Home Office in March 2002 that there was no evidence that Iraq had any involvement in the 9/11 attacks.\nWhile there were reports of links between the regime of Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, there was no intelligence to suggest meaningful co-operation between the two.\nIn that letter, she said the possibility Iraq might use terrorist tactics to defend its own territory in the event of an invasion could not be ruled out.\nBut she stressed Iraqi agents did not have \"much capability\" to carry out UK attacks, adding her view of this never changed.\nIn his evidence in January, Tony Blair described Saddam Hussein as a \"monster\" and said the world was a safer place with him no longer in control of Iraq.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "The invasion of Iraq \"substantially\" increased the terrorist threat to the UK, the former head of MI5 has said.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

On one level it's about chasing the dream and the cost of trying to live it. The themes that come out of the play are issues of loyalty and trust and betrayal, and secrets within families and how people collude and how ultimately everything can come falling down.\nThe themes are so universal - what would you do for your family? Joe Keller thinks anything is forgivable because it's been done for his family but he doesn't have a wider social responsibility. That's his downfall.\nThe 2013 production earned five star reviews - does that add pressure to taking it out two years later?\nI haven't thought about it. If I did I might not sleep too well. I guess it might add a bit of pressure.\nI read reviews, you can't help it. One has to be able to take them - the good and the bad.\nGiven that it was such a hit, how much are you tweaking this time round?\nLike with any fantastic play once you get to revisit it you realise its depth - we are finding so many new things. Half the cast are different so it can't be the same because they bring new elements. It just goes to show the quality of the text: there's always more to unearth.\nDoes having a black cast give the play a new perspective?\nIt certainly gives it a nuance. If you think of a black family trying to achieve the American dream suddenly the stakes become higher still because of black history in the US.\nBut it essentially remains the same story: it's a family drama, and this family is an all-American family.\nYou took over Talawa in 2012 - are there still things you want to achieve?\nI'm just at the beginning. The past three years have been great and we are starting to achieve some of things we set out to do. It's great that we get do do All My Sons, and we get to work with the companies like the  National Theatre as we did last year with Moon on a Rainbow Shawl.\nWe've got a writers' programme working with the Bush and Soho Theatres and the BBC, and we have a space we are desperate to develop into a 100-seat venue. We are looking for funding to do that.\nWhat's the latest on workshops you've had with Lenny Henry on a play about the American comedian Richard Pryor?\nWe are still in the workshopping process. It's in development. I hope it will come to the stage. We are both keen to see it happen.\nAll My Sons, with a cast led by Ray Shell and Dona Croll, has opened at Ipswich's New Wolsey Theatre, and tours until 25 April. A full list of tour dates is on the Talawa website.\nFollowing its sell-out run at the Young Vic, A View from the Bridge, with Mark Strong leading the cast, opens at the West End's Wyndham's Theatre on 16 February, and is now in preview.\nThe RSC's production of Miller's 1949 Pulitzer prize-winning Death of a Salesman begins previews in March at Stratford-upon-Avon, with Antony Sher and Alex Hassell as father and son, Willy Loman and Biff.\nSian Phillips leads the cast of Sheffield Theatres' revival of Arthur Miller's Playing for Time from 12 March - 4 April at the Crucible.\nA drama originally written by Miller for the big screen, The Hook - about corruption in New York's docks - has its world premiere at Northampton's Royal and Derngate theatre on 5-27 June.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "The centenary year of playwright Arthur Miller's birth is being marked with an explosion of productions around the UK in 2015.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

But the BBC's Wyre Davies put the turnout at 10,000 people, which he said was the biggest protest seen in Jordan for several years.\nVideo footage showed protesters chanting slogans and waving flags. The AFP news agency quoted people as shouting: \"We demand constitutional reform before the people revolt. The people want to reform the regime.\"\nA counter-rally, in support of King Abdullah, which organisers had predicted would attract 200,000 supporters, was cancelled late on Thursday in order to prevent clashes between the two groups.\nEarlier, police said they had detained eight people travelling towards the rally and had seized three vehicles containing sticks, knives and guns.\nFriday's protest in the capital and the dissolution of parliament come amid mounting opposition anger at the electoral law passed in July by the government of the conservative Prime Minister Fayez al-Tarawneh.\nThe electoral law increased the number of seats in the House of Representatives from 120 to 150 seats and gave the electorate two votes - one for a district representative and one for national level lists that include political parties - replacing the single non-transferable vote.\nThe IAF's leader, Hamza Mansour, dismissed the legislation as \"just a cosmetic change meant to buy time and insufficient for real reforms\".\nOpposition parties demanded that 50% of seats be allocated to party lists, but the new electoral law gave them just 27 seats, or 18%.\nThey also complained that the new law would strengthen supporters of the king by allocating three more seats for women from Bedouin districts.\nThis, they argued, would continue to marginalise Jordanians of Palestinian origin - who make up 60% of the population but have little political power - in favour of those descended from Jordan's original Bedouin inhabitants - whose tribes dominate the government and security forces and are the bedrock of the Hashemite monarchy.\nTraditionally, many of the IAF's supporters have been Jordanians of Palestinian origin.\nThe opposition also demanded that parliament, rather than the king, should have the right to appoint and dismiss the prime minister.\nDespite the call for reforms, Jordan has so far avoided the unrest and political upheaval that rocked much of the Arab world last year.

If anything, they've been better than they were last season. With Rangers in the league, with a stronger Hearts team, they've still been the second-top team in Scotland and I think Derek and his players deserve enormous credit for that.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"Even if Rangers were to win (on Sunday), I don't think they will finish second. Aberdeen have been so consistent, especially at home, so I fully expect Rangers to lose.\"\nThe Dons have made Pittodrie a fortress this season, embarking on a 10-game winning streak on their home patch.\nThey may have been eased aside by all-conquering Celtic in November's League Cup final, but have the chance to reach another national showpiece when they face Hibernian in the Scottish Cup last four on 22 April.\n\"Derek can't win the league, not against this Celtic side,\" Thompson added. \"Success can be measured in other ways. To reach both cup finals would be success in itself, to finish second, to get European football again, to break records - I'm not sure what else he can do.\n\"The consistency they've shown in the last two seasons has been phenomenal.

I found that puzzling.\n\"Possibly even more puzzling was to name the Aberdeen team. I think he's trying to show he's done his homework, but you can pretty much name the Aberdeen team because it doesn't change too often.\n\"If I was Derek McInnes, what would I think of that? Is it mind games? It's not very good mind games, if you ask me.\"\nThompson, who made over 60 appearances for Rangers, says Caixinha's carefree style sits in stark contrast with the rigidity and structure of his predecessor, Mark Warburton.\nThe 46-year-old led the Gers to a thumping win over Hamilton Academical in his first game in charge, but has since dropped points with successive draws against Motherwell and Kilmarnock.\n\"It's far too early to be making judgements,\" Thompson asserted. \"None of these players are Caixinha's players. I suspect in the summer you'll see a substantial recruitment drive.\n\"One thing that struck me is he's not afraid to do something radical. I know he had injury problems, but he took off three of his back-four, completely changed his shape against Motherwell. That raised a few eyebrows, although they got back into the game.\n\"Caixinha looks like he's going to start taking risks. With that, you have to make sure you're getting results as well.

In 2012, it withdrew from the main Russia-led regional military bloc, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation.\nPolitical instability caused by Mr Karimov's demise could be felt far beyond Uzbekistan's borders.\nThe country is rich in natural resources, including oil, gas and gold, and any turbulence may push up the price of these commodities on world markets.\nTension could could also spill over into Uzbekistan's energy-rich neighbours, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.\nRegional transport corridors may be disrupted, including gas and oil pipelines running to Russia and China.\nUzbekistan also supplies electricity to Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and southern Kazakhstan.\nUzbekistan lies on key opium routes from Afghanistan to Russia and on to Europe, and drug smugglers could take advantage of instability to distract or disrupt law-enforcement efforts.\nPresident Karimov has never been shy of deploying his powerful security apparatus to exercise a firm grip on power.\nThis, among other things, has enabled him to maintain a delicate balance between the various ethnic groups inside the country.\nShould it be upset, the ripple effect may be felt as far away as in China. Uzbekistan hosts a sizeable Uighur community, and the predominantly Muslim Uighur minority in China has long been seen as a source of concern by Beijing.\nPresident Karimov's successor will also inherit unresolved border differences with Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

By the middle of the previous century, most of the lowland areas, particularly in south Wales, were under English control, in the form of Anglo-Norman barons from the Marches and across Glamorganshire to Pembroke.\nGwynedd and the north-west of Wales remained largely independent. Welsh princes acknowledged the ruler Llywelyn the Great and his successor Llywelyn ap Gruffudd as the overarching Prince of Wales. But as the century wore away, and Edward I of England came to power, the balance of power changed as Llywelyn refused to pay tribute to Edward.\nIn 1276 Edward I led an invasion into Gwynedd and forced Llywelyn into the very top corner of the country, and set about his castle-building programme. An uprising in 1282 led to renewed fighting, and saw the death of Llywelyn. By the following year it was over, and English domination over Wales was entrenched. Edward's son, the future Edward II, was created Prince of Wales.\nAt the start of the 1200s, Welsh was the language of the common people.\nIt was how people did business, conducted family life and worshipped. By the end of the century, daily business was increasingly done in English.\nEnglish settlers were encouraged to move to Wales by free land grants and the imposition of English law.\nAs the settlers moved into the more fruitful lowlands, Welsh speakers were increasingly pushed to the higher ground, although there was crossover between the two.\nOne of the main changes through the course of the 13th Century was the difference in the way people paid for things.\nAccording to Dr Mark Redknap, head of collections and research in the history department at the Museum of Welsh Life, the old system of \"render\" was starting to change.\n\"It's fair to say that from about the end of the 13th Century the Welsh were more familiar with using money than they had been a century earlier,\" he said.\n\"You had an increasing use of coinage whereas there is very much a barter economy with the pre-Norman period, and payment in kind.\"\nHe said taxes to the English king were paid in cash. Coinage though was still more at the stage where the actual weight of the coins, in silver for example, was what provided the value rather than a nominal amount printed on the coin.\nAs well as tithes paid to the church, Llywelyn had tried to levy tax on cattle and in lieu of military service. But it was Edward I who pushed formalised tax collection.\nBy the time of his death in 1307, tax revenue from Wales had tripled.\nAccording to Gerald of Wales, the Welsh were a militaristic society, more concerned with learning to fight rather than ploughing their land more than necessary.\nBut this only applied to free men: about a third of the population at the start of the century were bonded to a lord and worked for them on large estates.\nThe common people wore simple clothes: a tunic and thin cloak.\nAlthough much of Wales was rural, with large forests being an important source of food and resources for many, fledgling towns had been established by the Normans in places like Carmarthen and Cardiff and by the end of the century there were around 90 small towns, although few had populations over 1,000.\nIt is worth remembering that the population of Wales was tiny in comparison to now, with the whole population equivalent to modern-day Cardiff.\nSources: BBC History; St Fagans National History Museum; The People of Wales ed Gareth Elwyn Jones and Dai Smith\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "As the Welsh government publishes plans to reintroduce Welsh taxes for the first time since the 13th century, BBC News looks at what life was like in Wales last time there was direct Welsh taxation.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

A crucial moment that had a huge bearing on this match as Dundee took control.\nWighton has been a hotly tipped young prospect for some time. Against Well, he was excellent.\nThere was a lot of huff and puff from Dundee in the first-half, but that little bit of quality in the final third came from the jinking feet of the 19-year-old.\nThe striker has imagination, skill, awareness and a directness that frightens defenders.\nHe created both goals. For the first, his effort was saved before Cammy Kerr fired home the rebound.\nFor the second, Wighton showed skill, strength and drive before cutting back for Haber to score his first Dundee goal.\nWighton almost capped his superb display with a great run and shot that was well saved by Samson. He deserved a goal for his all-round display.\nA lot has been said about how tight the Premiership is this season, as long as runaway leaders Celtic are taken out of the equation.\nThat was the case here for large parts, although the ghost goal incident was pivotal in this game.\nDundee were the better side after taking the lead, but Motherwell were the better side for most of the first-half.\nThey created several chances - McDonald had a close-range header saved, Lionel Ainsworth had a corner tipped on to the bar and a shot blocked.\nThe ghost goal changed this game. From there, Dundee took their chance, got their goal, took control and - crucially - got themselves off the bottom of the table for a while at least.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nDundee manager Paul Hartley: \"The first home win of the season. I felt we deserved that today.\n\"We might have got a wee bit of a break with Motherwell's so-called goal, I haven't really seen it, but it's the breaks that we have not had.\n\"I felt we were comfortable today in the way that we played. Second-half, I thought we were excellent and we deserved that today.\n\"Craig Wighton has been around and about the squad from a young age, from 15, a lot of expectation put on his shoulders, but we have tried to ease him in there at times.\n\"But now we feel has matured, he has got stronger and you have seen in his performance today and even last week there is a different side to him now in terms of on the ball but even off the ball in his defensive work.\n\"Craig has got such outstanding ability and talent and that is the standard he has set himself now. I think it's his time now.\"\nMotherwell manager Mark McGhee: \"I have seen the video again, I saw it at the time, I could see clearly. The boy's feet are over the line, the balls ahead of him.\n\"There is absolutely no doubt it is a goal. It is an absolutely shocking decision.\n\"I just asked [the referee] for an explanation. Of course they don't speak to you.\n\"I'm as angry with my own team's first-half performance as I am with the referee's decision, or the linesman's decision.\n\"We made poor decisions, we never did the things we spoke about - getting down the sides of their back three.

We can do double,\" he wrote.\nA boxer-turned-insurgent and now a self-styled \"foot soldier\" of President Putin, the man known simply as Ramzan is not someone many in Russia dare criticise openly.\nHuman rights groups have long accused him of presiding over widespread abuses in the Russian republic, and the key suspect in last year's shock shooting of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov beside the Kremlin walls had been deputy commander of one of his elite battalions. He was referred to by Ramzan as a \"true patriot\".\nThis time, the Chechen leader's comments appear to have touched a nerve.\nThe most dramatic response came from a little-known independent politician in Siberia, who raged against Ramzan on his Facebook page as the \"shame of Russia\".\n\"Why don't you get lost?\" Konstantin Senchenko told him, and let \"normal, honest people\" work for the good of the country.\nBut the Siberian was soon eating his \"hasty\" words. The next day, he apologised profusely on Facebook for his \"discourtesy\", apparently after multiple calls from Chechnya.\nCartoons of his sudden change of heart soon spread on social media, depicting him begging forgiveness with a gun to his head.\nIn an ultimate humiliation, the shamefaced politician was seen in a video clip apologising personally to Ramzan for his \"emotional outburst\".\nActivists on Twitter then took up the Siberian's insult with the hashtag #KadyrovshameofRussia.\nWell-known opposition journalists followed that by filming themselves making fake, grovelling apologies to Ramzan \"for existing\".\nOne was filmed running on a treadmill with no trousers, just as a young Chechen man was forced to do recently after criticising Ramzan Kadyrov on Instagram.\nMeanwhile, a group of prominent Russian liberals has begun gathering signatures demanding his resignation, and a St Petersburg politician has called on prosecutors to examine his statements for extremism.\nBut the backlash has only increased the tirade from Chechnya, where local politicians have been falling over themselves to express devotion to their leader.\nNone has outdone the speaker of parliament, Magomed Daudov, who posted a photograph of his boss holding back his huge, fierce dog on a leash and warned that Tarzan's teeth were \"itching\" - naming four well-known opposition figures whom the hound would presumably love to sink them into.\n\"Tarzan has become very frisky. We can barely restrain him,\" wrote the speaker in an Instagram post that attracted over 6,000 likes. \"Just imagine what would happen\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 If it weren't for\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Democracy.\"\nThere is some talk that this is all a show of strength by the Chechen leader: a reminder of the considerable forces at his disposal amid talk of a power struggle between Grozny and Moscow.\nBut the Kremlin has remained tight-lipped throughout, prompting others to conclude that it more likely endorses Ramzan's actions.\nParliamentary elections are due later this year and, with an economy battered by falling oil prices, there's concern that opposition groups could capitalise on potential social unrest.\n\"It's a message to all of those who don't agree with what's happening,\" argues former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is now an opposition activist in exile and himself one of the obvious targets of Ramzan Kadyrov's ire.\n\"The authorities are afraid and they decided to frighten society,\" wrote Mr Khodorkovsky on his blog.\nAnother commentator has suggested that the Chechen leader simply wants to underline his loyalty to Moscow ahead of a wave of forced budget cuts and to ensure that the generous flow of federal subsidies to Chechnya does not stop.\nWhatever the motive, the practice of singling out traitors is seen as particularly dangerous in the wake of Boris Nemtsov's murder.\nA year ago, Putin loyalists were still beating the drum of patriotism following the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine; state TV was lashing out viciously at Kremlin critics; warnings that Ukraine-style revolutions would not be tolerated were rife.\nRamzan Kadyrov's latest outburst has resurrected the idea of an enemy within and the search for a scapegoat.\n\"The situation is very tense now,\" Mr Senchenko, explained by phone from Krasnoyarsk, pointing to Russia's mounting economic problems.\nThat concern is what motivated his own Facebook rage against Chechnya's leader.\n\"Some people really think there are enemies of the state and it's not clear what can enter their heads,\" he warned.  \"So we need to be careful.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Traitors, jackals and vile liberals are just a few of the choice descriptions of Russia's opposition emerging from Chechnya in recent days, in a war of words that threatens to escalate.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

I think this amount of rumour and allegation and counter-allegation\u2026 is disgraceful.\"\nBefore it shut its doors on Wednesday, Kids Company provided practical, emotional and educational support to some of the most deprived and vulnerable inner-city children and young people in London, Liverpool and Bristol.\nThe charity, founded in 1996 by Camila Batmanghelidjh, was well known for its famous and wealthy supporters who included David Cameron, but has been closed amid a row over funding.\nIn addition to the allegations being made to Newsnight, a former client of the charity has told BBC News that, when she was 16, she was touched inappropriately by a 24-year-old man who was also a client of the charity at that time.\nShe said she attempted to tell a teacher at the charity, which provides educational services, but the conversation was stopped before she could explain she had been assaulted.\nKate (not her her real name) said the sexual assaults took place over a period of seven months in 2009, and occurred at one Kids Company site.\n\"He would touch me in inappropriate places,\" she said.\n\"He would have his dirty comments like how he would like to do certain things. I got pushed to the wall once as well when he threatened me and said that if I didn't comply to his wishes then he would get me.\"\nKate explained what happened when she tried to tell a teacher working at the charity what she had been going through.\nShe said she telephoned the teacher and opened the conversation with an explanation that she was being harassed, but the teacher ended the conversation and put the phone down before she could mention the sexual assault allegations.\nKate explained that some of those attending Kids Company with her were not \"kids\" but men in their 20s.\n\"Everyone was way older, they are all adult, not kids, they shouldn't be there. I was intimidated anyway, I felt intimidated by these men,\" she said.\nResponding to Kate's claim, Ms Batmanghelidjh said: \"I would be very concerned if a staff member turned round and said they can't do anything about it.\n\"I'd be very surprised and if a staff member, one staff member, had done that there were lots of others to go to.\"\nKids Company employs 600 paid staff, as well as working with a pool of about 8,000 volunteers and 500 students.\nOne woman who was a paid employee of the charity in 2009 claimed she was the victim of a sexual assault by a co-worker on a night out.\nElla (not her real name) said the man forced his hand into her underwear and had to be pulled away by people around them. She said she reported the incident to the charity, but it was never dealt with properly.\nElla said she was promised the accused co-worker would be kept away from Kids Company until Ms Batmanghelidjh had spoken to him, but the next day he was back on site.\nIn emails seen by the BBC, Camilla Batmanghelidjh wrote to Ella: \"In relation to ******** and the police, that I would support you 100% and that in this situation you were my priority.\"\nHowever, she also questioned the woman's boundaries, writing: \"I'm not excusing *********'s behaviour or saying that your behaviour led to it. I'm merely asking you to be much, much clearer about establishing robust boundaries.\"\nElla said she felt scared that little had been done - and that the man had not been suspended and continued to work at Kids Company.\nElla herself reported the sexual assault allegation to police, but chose not to press charges.\nIn the Newsnight investigation, it heard that male clients of the charity's Urban Academy in their 20s had forced young clients - girls aged 16 to 18 - to have sex with them.\nReferring to one such man, a former employee said: \"There'd be repercussions if they didn't\u2026 you have to do it, he'd blackmail them.\"\nShe said the girls were told: \"If you don't do it I'll tell them about this, this, this and this. Or [he would] photograph them naked and then threaten to send it around to other people.\"\nThis employee claims that these allegations had been raised with staff, and she knew of them herself, but said they were not passed on. Newsnight has confirmed that the allegations of coerced sex made by witnesses to the programme were not known to the authorities.\nA week ago, the Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into Kids Company led by Scotland Yard's child abuse command.\nCamila Batmanghelidjh has emphatically denied any wrongdoing.\nShe told BBC News: \"We've already had lawyers go through the details.\n\"There isn't an allegation that will stand. I'm telling you.  Now.  In 19 years we haven't had a single Child Protection problem in the organisation.   And whenever something is raised with us we immediately report it to the police. \"\nSpeaking to Newsnight later, Ms Batmanghelidjh said the allegations of sexual exploitation by Kids Company clients of other clients were brought to the charity's notice for the first time by police recently.\nShe added: \"If such a thing had taken place on our premises it would have triggered all our safeguarding procedures. I have absolutely no awareness of it.\n\"And there is no awareness of this incident having taken place at Kids Company premises or brought to Kids Company's attention. We would have totally reported something like that.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "The Kids Company charity failed in its handling of allegations of serious incidents, including sexual assaults, former staff have said.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

I have regained strength and feel motivated.\n\"It has not been easy to find work after the ruling but I am not complaining. The tunnel is nearing its end.\"\nHe entered that tunnel in 1990 when his contract with RFC Liege expired. With the club in financial trouble they wanted the midfielder to sign a new deal on a quarter of his former salary.\nYet when Dunkerque, across the border in France, wanted to buy him, Liege demanded four times what they'd paid for him in the first place.\n\"It was illogical,\" said Bosman, explaining the moment he decided to become a \"freedom fighter\".\nHis lawyer thought it would take two weeks. It took five years; a period that should have been the best years of a decent career.\nBanned in Belgium, Bosman moved to a second division club in France, only for them to go bust. Other clubs told him they would like to sign him but could not because they already had three foreigners.\nHe had a brief spell on the island of La Reunion and another go in the Belgian leagues, but it is an understatement to say his decision to take football's business model to court made him less attractive to club chairmen.\nBroke, tired and out of shape, he accepted 350,000 Swiss francs in damages for his legal victory and began a life after football that he is still trying to work out.\nThere was a disastrous investment in a t-shirt business (he had hoped grateful footballers would buy one, only his lawyer's son did so) and problems with the taxman.\nIn 2011, he was convicted of assault following claims he had been involved in an argument with his girlfriend after he asked her daughter to get him some booze.  Initially, the courts were lenient but when he failed to pay his fine they were left with little choice. He was sentenced to a year in prison in 2013.\nIt was then that Fifpro, the international trade union for footballers, stepped in. The stars he had helped become multi-millionaires may have forgotten him but his union did not.\n\"I was young and handsome then and I now have become old,\" he explained.\n\"Most of the players won't be able to recognise me but my case is still being talked about - I think that is positive.\n\"I may not be here in 20 years' time but they will still be talking about it and if someone remembers me I will give him my bank details. Everyone benefited from the Bosman ruling except me!\"\nI am speaking to him at Fifpro's swish headquarters in a suburb of Amsterdam. Bosman has become a spokesman for the organisation's campaign to finish what he started: scrap transfer fees entirely.\nThe best way to understand this is to view Bosman as a battle in a 125-year war between clubs and players.\nThe players won Bosman but were \"ambushed\", in the words of Fifpro's general secretary Theo van Seggelen, six years later. The European Commission made a deal with the game's governing bodies, Uefa and Fifa, to stem what the clubs claimed was rampant \"player power\".\nThis deal was enshrined in Fifa's Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players in 2001.\nThese rules set out today's transfer system - windows - the concept of a protected period when a contract cannot be broken, maximum and minimum contract lengths and so on - and for Fifpro they amount to the pendulum swinging towards the clubs.\nFive years later, a row about Scottish defender Andy Webster's move from Hearts to Wigan Athletic saw that pendulum swing back.\nThe details of the case are convoluted but the final ruling seemed to fix what compensation a player/new employer should pay the old employer for breaking a contract outside of the protected period. This sum would be the wages the player would earn if he stayed.\nThis really could have been revolutionary but two years later the Court of Arbitration for Sport changed the compensation equation by adding pro rata slices of the initial transfer fee and an estimate of the player's replacement cost.\nPlayers such Andrea Pirlo or Robert Lewandowski could still let their contracts expire to get Bosman moves to new teams and bigger wages. But clubs wanting to sign players still under contract, even outside the protected period, would have to cough up some compensation, as Manchester City did with Raheem Sterling last summer.\nQuite right too, is the usual response to this compromise between a player's right to ply his trade on the one hand, and a club's right to stability and a league's competitive integrity on the other.\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez, the first Spanish player to get a Bosman to England, has criticised the transfer window, but does not want to scrap compensation.\n\"The Bosman ruling was a huge shock at the time but I used it and it now seems a normal way to move freely,\" said Martinez last week.\n\"Football has benefited from the multicultural input of players and it seems normal now.\n\"But it wouldn't be right to scrap transfer fees. The value of a footballer is important and the value of developing players is important.\"\nBut Fifpro's Van Seggelen says this view is based on a misunderstanding of the players' position, as well as being unfounded in truth.\nDr Stefan Szymanski, author of the best-selling Soccernomics and professor of sports management at the University of Michigan, did some research for Fifpro earlier this year which outlined how the system was failing to do any of the things it promised in 2001.\nAccording to Szymanski, the settlement has led to the rich clubs getting richer as more than half of all transfer spending circulates among them, with little trickling down the pyramid, far less than is syphoned off by agents.\nHe also outlined how the same clubs and leagues keep winning, while the same types of clubs and leagues keep failing, leaving themselves, he says, vulnerable to match-fixing, third-party ownership and the trafficking of minors.\n\"We thought the transfer system was finished on 15 December, 1995, but of course it isn't,\" explained Van Seggelen.\n\"In fact, the situation is even worse than before. I often say to people 'how would you feel if you had to wait three months for your salary?'\n\"You also have players waiting years for justice through the tribunal system, and even when he has a positive decision there is no enforcement system. We cannot accept that.\"\nThat might win over a few more voters on the terraces but there will still be many in the \"Bosman ruined football\" camp who think this is simply a union fighting for more money for its members, and in this case the members are loaded.\n\"Only 1% of our members are financially independent, so not every player is making that kind of money,\" said Van Seggelen.\n\"We're not trying to make them richer. In an ideal world, every player would play at the level they belong.\n\"I don't know why the clubs are so nervous. We are not trying to kill the top clubs or leagues.\n\"Sport is unusual but it must be reasonable. It's an economic activity, a business, so it must respect the law.\"\nBy this point, Bosman is outside smoking.\nDespite arriving late and looking like he could not wait for the interview to end, he was good company.\nHe does not watch much football these days, he cannot afford the television subscriptions, but what he sees he enjoys.\nHis main focus is looking after his two young boys and being a better dad to the grown-up daughter he has from an earlier relationship.\n\"Martin and Samuel are too young to know about my case, I don't want to complicate their lives with it, they've just left kindergarten,\" he said.\n\"But I think later, when they grow up, they could find out about what their dad has done for professional players on the internet and they will see their dad has done something good.\n\"Back then clubs were selling hens, horses, mules and pigs, but not humans.\n\"Players should be considered as workers, full stop, that's it! This is the Bosman ruling, and we ought to get back to it.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "A Cruyff turn, Fergie time, the Matthews final: football's icons have often entered the language of the sport but can any of those greats claim to have changed the game as much as the nervous, middle-aged Belgian sitting in front of me?", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

All the FOMC participants recognise that there is considerable uncertainty about how economic policy may change and what effect they may have on the economy.\"\nAlso, she declined to be drawn on Mr Trump's public comments about the Fed, and his use of tweets to announce policy and criticise companies.\n\"I'm a strong believer in the independence of the Fed,\" she told journalists. \"I am not going to offer the incoming president advice.\"\nThe interest rate move had been widely expected, and followed the last increase a year ago.\nRates have been near zero since the global financial crisis. But the US economy is recovering, underlined by recent data on consumer confidence, jobs, house prices and growth in manufacturing and services.\nMs Yellen said the rate rise \"should certainly be understood as a reflection of the confidence we have in the progress that the economy has made and our judgment that that progress will continue\".\nAlthough inflation is still below the Fed's 2% target, it expects the rise in prices to pick up gradually over the medium term.\n\"The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate,\" the Fed statement said.\nIt added: \"The federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.\"\nThe Fed also published its economic forecasts for the next three years.\nThese suggest that the Federal Funds rate may rise to 1.4% next year; 2.1% in 2018; and 2.9% in 2019.\nGDP growth will rise to 2.1% next year and stay there, more or less, during those years.\nThe unemployment rate will fall to 4.5% over the 2017-2019 period, the Fed forecast.\nAnd inflation will rise to 1.9% next year and hover at that level for the next two years.\nThe dollar rose 0.5% against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac0.9455, and was 0.9% higher against the yen at 116.17 yen.\nWall Street's main stock markets were largely unmoved immediately after the Fed's announcement, but drifted lower later. The Dows Jones index closed down 0.6%, and the S&P 500 was 0.8% lower.\nThere's a name missing from the Federal Reserve's statement - Donald Trump. The president-elect's surprise triumph at the polls last month has turned out to be a short term boost to the US economy.\nStock markets have surged higher, and consumer confidence indicators show US consumers feeling even more upbeat. The challenge for the Fed is working out what his election may mean to the economy in the next year or so.\nThe most obvious likely impact could come from tax cuts which both he and the Republican Congress seem to favour. Less certain is an infrastructure spending spree that Mr Trump would evidently like, but which many in Congress are less keen on.\nIf Janet Yellen and her colleagues considered these political issues, they weren't mentioned in the official statement on monetary policy. Nevertheless Mr Trump has a way of breaking in to most conversations these days.\nAnd the first question asked of Ms Yellen at her press conference duly concerned America's next president - and she admitted that Mr Trump's impact on US tax and spending policies might have influenced some of her colleagues forecasts for next year.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "The US Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.25%, only the second increase in a decade.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

I got it like other people on our network.  The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos.  I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence.  I've been sleeping here most of the time since.\nOur social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change.  It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks.\nI like to think the social network is the people itself.  Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools.  When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people.  Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline.\nThis is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality.  If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted.  It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square.\nAt the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection.  I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through.\nI hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism.  At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet.\nTwitter: Amr Gharbeia\nI was involved in this revolution from the first day, 25 January, and I've now been spending my nights here for a while. For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting.  As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground.\nAt first we were mocking the event on 25 January.  We questioned whether it was really possible to have a \"Facebook revolution\". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before.  I was walking among the people and weeping.\nNow I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs.  I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom.\nBlogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.  This regime stopped us from doing that.  We had have poor education and no national cultural programmes.  I am so proud now, especially when I think of our young martyrs.  In Egypt we have suffered a lot and it's about time that we start to live like real people.\nTwitter: Nawara Negm\nI'm not writing my blog right now.  We're just using Twitter as it's easy and flexible to do from your mobile.  If we have a lot of action here I might do as many as 20 or 30 tweets a day.  We also use Bambuser for live-streaming from our mobiles here in Tahrir Square.\nThe internet gave us our backbone but it is not because of Facebook that this happened.  It was the force used by the police that brought everybody together.  If they had let us leave peacefully on 25 January, this would never have happened.  It got worse with the violence on 28th: The shootings, the tear gas, the killings, the brutality.  When they cut the internet and mobile phone lines this only increased people's anger.\nIn the square we have organised our lives well. We have a co-ordinating committee telling us where there have been attacks and a group doing cleaning.  We have some people singing and some praying. We have Christians, Muslims, agnostics, leftists and rightists and we all live together well.   In our community we're trying to set an example of how we can all live together.  It's like a city inside the city here.  We are the kernel of the revolution.\nBlog: MaLek X (in Arabic)\nThe revolution was publicised on the internet.  The spark was Facebook.  People were really sceptical about it because they didn't think you could have a revolution where you named the date, but now I look around me and I am really proud of the Egyptian people and the initiative.  I'm sure that those who named the date didn't think things would go this far.\nTo begin with on 25 January, we had mostly young people of all classes who somehow use the internet.  You have internet cafes even in the poorest areas of Egypt so even less well-educated people have access, especially to Facebook.  A lot was also achieved through word of mouth - people telling their friends and neighbours.  The independent media took a middle-ground to begin with as everyone was watching their backs but now they have got onboard.\nAfter our huge turnout on the first Tuesday, demonstrations continued for the next two days and we publicised further action for Friday on the internet.  That day they cut our communications and took our cameras so we had an information blackout and the violence was unbelievable. A lot of people died.\nStill the threshold of fear and pain had been broken and we have kept up momentum since. Now older people especially come up to us when we're collecting trash or whatever in the square and they say: \"We're really proud of you... You did what we didn't manage to do for 60 years.\"\nPeople have called this the \"Facebook Revolution\" because it gave us a form of expression even when people were too scared to talk in big groups about political issues.  We had already set up Facebook pages for people who were tortured to death.  We found it was a way to talk without being tracked.\nIn the square we have bridged a lot of gaps.  I've been living here since 29 January with tens of thousands of other people.  I put my head down to sleep and I don't know the people sleeping around me. I have wonderful conversations with people from all over Egypt who normally I would never have talked to.\nWe're finally getting to know each other. It's wonderful.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Egypt's internet activists have played a key role in the pro-democracy protests from the outset, but they tell the BBC that the online campaigning is evolving to suit their real-life activism in Tahrir Square.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The Korean government eventually declares a state of emergency and martial law.\nAt the heart of the chaos is actor Gong Yoo, a typically-workaholic South Korean businessman travelling with his estranged daughter, oblivious to the unfolding apocalypse.\nThe monsters are fast, really fast, and their attacks lightning speed, putting their Hollywood counterparts from World War Z to shame.\nEqually terrifying is the infection and the rate at which it spreads rapidly between those unlucky enough to be trapped onboard as the high-speed train races to its final destination.\nTo young Koreans like student Hahn Kwan-woo, 23, it is the film they have been waiting for.\n\"Western films featuring zombies have always been huge hits in our country and there was not a single Korean zombie movie until 'Train to Busan' came out,\" he said.\n\"Many of my favourite actors also star in the movie.\"\nIt may have all the predictable elements of a zombie story, but aficionados have also praised the film's uniquely South Korean take on the genre.\n\"With a Mers epidemic [Middle East respiratory syndrome] sweeping South Korea in 2015 and soaring discontent with corruption and economic disparity, a zombie apocalypse serves as a potent allegory for the dog-eat-dog world,\" film critic Maggie Lee explained in one review.\nStunning visual and special effects and \"lean, gritty\" screenplay also could not have hurt its chances of domestic success.\nOther critics praised the \"brilliant\" choice of setting on a Korean bullet train.\n\"I even have a friend who loved it because she takes the same train every time she goes home,\" said Mr Hahn.\nBut timing was also key, due to the appetite for summertime horror movies, said Jean Lee, a journalist and Wilson Center Global Fellow who also teaches Korean culture and film courses.\n\"South Korean horror films really took off in the late 1990s and 'Train to Busan' is a new twist on the horror genre,\" she told BBC News from Seoul.\n\"Most horror movies here are released in the summer, when the heat and humidity send people into air-conditioned theatres for movies that quite literally send a chill up their spines.\"\nOf course the best part about zombie movies is getting to see the best and worst of humanity, as the world comes to an end.\n\"'Train to Busan': Best zombie scare ever. This is coming from someone who can't even watch 'The Walking Dead',\" wrote one fan on Twitter, referencing the popular US drama series.\nSome even proclaimed it the \"best zombie movie\" they have ever seen.\nFans like 24-year-old Oh Won-heo hope the movie will propel home-grown horror films to an international audience.\n\"When people mention Asian horror, they think of Japan. But Korean horror tales are truly frightening and I hope 'Train to Busan' will make the world realise that our local movies are just as scary - or even better.\"\nHowever, he added: \"For my sake, I hope Hollywood will not ruin it with a remake.\"\nOn that point he may be out of luck - European and US film studios are already reported to be vying to make their own version.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Snakes on planes are old hat - it's zombies on trains you need to worry about this year.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

There's a new kid on the block that's just moved in next door.\"\nThe new world joins other exoplanets such as Kepler-186f that are similar in many ways to Earth.\nDetermining which is most Earth-like depends on the properties one considers. Kepler-186f, announced in 2014, is smaller than the new planet, but orbits a red dwarf star that is significantly cooler than our own.\nKepler-452b, however, orbits a parent star which belongs to the same class as the Sun: it is just 4% more massive and 10% brighter. Kepler-452b takes 385 days to complete a full circuit of this star, so its orbital period is 5% longer than Earth's.\nThe mass of Kepler-452b cannot be measured yet, so astronomers have to rely on models to estimate a range of possible masses, with the most likely being five times that of Earth. If it is rocky, the world would likely still have active volcanism and its gravity could be roughly twice that on our own planet.\nThe new world is included in a haul of 500 new possible planets sighted by the Kepler space telescope around distant stars.\nTwelve of the new candidates are less than twice Earth's diameter, orbiting in the so-called habitable zone around their star.\nThis zone refers to a range of distances at which the energy radiated by the star would permit water to exist as a liquid on the planet's surface if certain other conditions are also met.\nOf these 500 candidates, Kepler-452b is the first to be confirmed as a planet.\nDr Suzanne Aigrain, from the University of Oxford, who was not involved with the study, told BBC News: \"I do believe the properties described for Kepler-452b are the most Earth-like I've come across for a confirmed planet to date.\n\"What seems even more significant to me is the number of planets in the habitable zone of their host stars with radii below two Earth radii; 12 is quite a few compared to the pre-existing Kepler planet catalogue.\n\"It bodes well for their attempts to provide a more robust measure of the incidence of Earth-like planets, which is the top-level goal of the Kepler mission.\"\nWhile similar in size and brightness to the Sun, Kepler-452b's host star is 1.5 billion years older than ours. Scientists working on the mission therefore believe it could point to a possible future for the Earth.\n\"If Kepler-452b is indeed a rocky planet, its location vis-a-vis its star could mean that it is just entering a runaway greenhouse phase of its climate history,\" explained Dr Doug Caldwell, a Seti Institute scientist working on the Kepler mission.\n\"The increasing energy from its aging sun might be heating the surface and evaporating any oceans. The water vapour would be lost from the planet forever.\"\n\"Kepler-452b could be experiencing now what the Earth will undergo more than a billion years from now, as the Sun ages and grows brighter.\"\nDr Don Pollacco, from Warwick University, UK, who was not involved with the latest analysis, told the BBC: \"Kepler data allows you to estimate the relative size of a planet to its host star, so if you know the size of the host, hey presto, you know the size of the planet.\n\"However, to go further - i.e. is it rocky? - involves measuring the mass of the planets and this is much more difficult to do as the stars are too far away for these measurements (which are incredibly difficult) to make.\n\"So in reality they have no idea what this planet is made of: It could be rock but it could be a small gassy ball or something more exotic maybe.\"\nDr Chris Watson, from Queen's University Belfast, UK, commented: \"Other Kepler habitable zone planets may well be more Earth-like in this respect. For example, Kepler-186f is approximately 1.17 Earth radii, and Kepler-438b is approximately 1.12 Earth radii.\n\"In fact, at 1.6 Earth radii, this would place Kepler-452b in a category of planet called a 'Super-Earth' - our Solar System does not actually have any planet of this type within it! Super-Earths are hugely interesting for this reason, but one might then say, well, is it really 'Earth-like' given all this?\"\nHe added: \"When we look at the type of star Kepler-452b orbits, then it seems to be a star not too dissimilar to our Sun... The other Kepler habitable zone planets that have been discovered so far tend to be orbiting M-dwarfs - stars far cooler than our Sun, and therefore the planets need to orbit much closer to receive the same levels of heating.\n\"So it may be a potentially rocky super-Earth in an Earth-like orbit (in terms of host star and orbital distance). It's this combination of the host star and orbit that set it apart in my opinion.\"\nThe findings have been accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal.\nFollow Paul on Twitter.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "A haul of planets from Nasa's Kepler telescope includes a world sharing many characteristics with Earth.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

It will take him some time to adjust to the power side of our game here, but the intelligence, the mobility and the technical level are good.\"\nWhile Elneny was steady between the penalty areas, Sanchez was pivotal inside the box.\nHe did not break stride to slam home his goal, created the opener for Chambers and looked lively throughout.

More and more, if coaches are not given a reasonable and realistic chance to get to where they want to be in a season, short-termism is of real concern.\"\nCockerill was sacked 12 games into the campaign with Leicester fifth in the table, just five points adrift of Bath in fourth spot, and having led Tigers to semi-finals in both the Premiership and European Champions Cup only last season.\nIn his eight years in charge, Leicester never failed to reach the Premiership play-offs - winning three titles and finishing runners-up twice.\nRobinson, the former England and Scotland head coach, was sacked by Bristol 10 games into the Premiership season, after guiding them back to the top flight following a seven-year absence last May.\n\"There is more short-termism because rugby is big business now,\" added Moon.\n\"There is more expectation on rugby coaches, certainly in the Premiership, to deliver - and if they are not delivering in a short time frame it would seem that owners are being more proactive than they have been in the past.\n\"Coaches seem to be judged on short-term goals and results. Are they judged a bit like football managers in their first two or three games? Or do you get to Christmas, Easter or the Premiership play-offs? That time period is getting smaller and smaller.\"\nSale director of rugby Steve Diamond admits his job is under scrutiny at the AJ Bell Stadium - with Sharks on an eight-match losing run - but he denies the turnover of coaches can be compared to football.\n\"Are we under pressure? Definitely, we need to get some results,\" Diamond told BBC Radio Manchester.\n\"But we know what we are doing and there is no-one better to get us out of the hole we are in than me.\"\nWhen asked if he thought recent sackings were reactionary, Diamond said: \"No, not really. Each club is run differently and every club has different pressures.\"\nTigers, English rugby's most successful club with 10 domestic titles, last won silverware in 2013, beating Northampton Saints in the last of nine straight Premiership final appearances.\nLeicester lock Ed Slater said the recent spate of sackings were \"what you guys want to write about\" when questioned by BBC Radio Leicester on the subject.\n\"Cockers had been here for a long time,\" he said. \"We haven't been to a Premiership final for three years now and at a club like Leicester we are aware of expectations and he ultimately paid the price - we know we want to win silverware and are expected to win silverware.\n\"Four years without something is a long spell.\"\nExeter boss Baxter said the growing popularity of Premiership rugby and increased riches in the game is where the pressure comes from.\n\"The demands of crowds and rugby clubs and the money that is starting to come into the game through TV, a lot of these things are very positive - we work very hard to build our supporter base and a product that people want to buy.\n\"Unfortunately, one of the repercussions of that is that people become more demanding. Sometimes, rightly or wrongly, in pursuit of success - or what is deemed to be success - someone pays the price.\n\"The fact the Premiership is so competitive is something people should cherish and not be too afraid of. That is the balance you would like to think most clubs would come to.\n\"You understand that a season will tilt with one or two injuries or one or two results. Having the strength to see that through is hopefully what we will get back to in rugby and we won't see a cascade of sackings.\n\"Some sackings and some changes of management happen for reasons outside of rugby results and those always happen - but when purely based on results people need a little more understanding.\"\nMoon says he spoke to Richard Bevan, chief executive of football's League Managers' Association (LMA), when forming the RCA and believes rugby coaches face some harsher realities than their football counterparts.\n\"Unlike football, there is not enough professional or semi-professional clubs out there to realistically believe that if you lose your job you will walk into another one at the same level immediately. It is very rare,\" said Moon.\n\"It is important that coaches get the right level of support and backing that their day job deserves.\n\"Richard was incredibly helpful when we identified this idea. They are a juggernaut of an organisation that have been going for a long time and they do invaluable work.\n\"We are some way behind that in the rugby world.\"\nChris Jones, BBC Radio 5 live rugby union reporter\n\"It is not necessarily a case that suddenly rugby union has adopted a different culture compared to before, but perhaps there are changes as a result of the competitiveness of the Premiership - influenced by the greater central revenues from Rugby Football Union and TV money - coupled with the new private investment at some clubs.\n\"There are probably seven or eight clubs who truly feel they should occupy the top four - or be even better off - in the Premiership.\n\"These clubs include Saracens, Wasps, Exeter, Bath, Leicester, Northampton, Harlequins, Gloucester, while Sale are a club that firmly considers themselves to be a top-six side. In saying that, Bristol, Worcester and Newcastle are all highly ambitious as well.\n\"Wasps and Sale have been boosted by fairly recent private investment, while Gloucester are on the verge of a takeover. Bristol have a billionaire owner too. These are people who all want success, while the traditional powerhouses such as Leicester, Northampton and Harlequins also demand results.\n\"No club is content with its status quo - maybe apart from European and Premiership champions Saracens - and with high expectations from fans and in the boardrooms, comes pressure on coaches - and sackings.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "The recent spike in Premiership sackings shows a \"worrying trend\", says the Rugby Coaches Association (RCA).", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Sony, which played a major part in killing off vinyl by developing CDs, has seen them replaced in turn by other music technology such as downloads and streaming, but vinyl is increasingly popular once again.\nThe format has been saved by a resurgence in demand, as it attracts not only nostalgic older consumers, but also younger generations who have rediscovered records, especially in clubs and at music festivals.\nSony is even struggling to find older engineers who know how to make records. Part of the reason for the popularity of vinyl records may be that you can actually sell them in shops. In the UK, record sales brought in more money last year than streaming platforms - although the unit costs of vinyl is many times that of streaming.\nVinyl records have been growing in popularity again in recent years, boosted by events such as Record Store Day in April every year, for which record companies produce special limited-edition singles and albums.\nSony's move comes a few months after it equipped its Tokyo studio with a cutting lathe, used to produce the master discs needed for manufacturing vinyl records.\nIt has not yet said which titles it will be pressing in vinyl, but big sellers in the format these days are a mixture of classic back-catalogue items and modern releases by new bands.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Sony Music, one of the big three global record companies, says it will start pressing its own vinyl releases again for the first time since 1989.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

They're now producing charts showing parts of Australia where sun protection may not be required during some parts of the year.\n\"Some of the messages about sun exposure have been too negative. UK summer sunshine isn't desperately strong. We don't have many days in the year when it is very intense.\n\"What's changed is that we're now saying that exposure of 10 to 15 minutes to the UK summer sun, without suncream, several times a week is probably a safe balance between adequate vitamin D levels and any risk of skin cancer.\"\nOfficial government advice already recommends vitamin D supplements for pregnant women and children aged under five.\nBut the experts who wrote the joint statement say mothers often are not made aware of this recommendation. They suggest women consult their GP.\nWinter levels of vitamin D can be helped by a break in the tropical sun - or by eating oily fish, liver and fortified margarine.\nCancer Research UK's chief clinician, Professor Peter Johnson, said: \"A good diet and sensible sun exposure will be adequate for the great majority of the UK population to minimise their cancer risk.\n\"The area of vitamin D and cancer is complex.\n\"There's some evidence, which is strongest in bowel cancer, that low levels of vitamin D in the blood correlate with the risk of developing cancer.\n\"But that doesn't mean those low levels cause bowel cancer.\n\"We think overall that low levels of vitamin D are unlikely to be major contributors to the chances of developing cancer in the UK population.\"\nThe joint statement also highlighted questions about vitamin D that warrant further research.\nThese include finding out the optimal levels of vitamin D, and more detail about the role of dietary sources and supplements.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "New health advice recommends short spells in the sun - without suncream and in the middle of the day.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

It's no good simply talking about violent extremism. We need to confront all extremism,\" he said.\nHe said its effectiveness would be measured by whether people were being turned away from extremism, stopped from travelling to fight for IS, and by having \"more cohesive and integrated communities\".\nHome Secretary Theresa May said non-violent extremism could not go \"uncontested\" as it led to the erosion of women's rights, the spread of intolerance and bigotry and the separation of some communities \"from the mainstream\".\nShe said that applied to neo-Nazi extremism just as much as Islamist doctrine.\nThe Muslim Council of Britain has released a highly-critical statement in response to the plans.\nSecretary general Dr Shuja Shafi said the strategy would \"reinforce perceptions that all aspects of Muslim life must undergo a 'compliance' test to prove our loyalty to this country\".\n\"These measures could be seen more as a means to address the anxieties a minority of people may have against Muslims and their religious life, rather than the scourge of terrorism itself,\" he said.\nDr Shafi also said he detected \"McCarthyist undertones\" in the plans to create blacklists and exclude and ban people those deemed to be extremists.\nMr Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, said the announcement was a \"missed opportunity to really engage the Muslim community\".\nBut Fiyaz Mughal, director of the interfaith Faith Matters organisation, said there was much in the plans that could \"help in the battle against those who promote extremism\".\nRobin Brant, BBC political correspondent\nAt the heart of this considerable strategy on counter extremism are two significant challenges for the prime minister: the internet and the law.\nGetting inciteful content off the web and getting \"counter narrative\" content up there is key to harnessing the full potential of a medium that IS has already mastered.\nThere has been much focus on the mosques but bedroom radicalisation is something the prime minister and MI5 worry intensely about.\nThe process of trying to persuade Facebook, Twitter and other social media giants to help is ongoing.\nOn the second point, the plans to introduce new powers to restrict what extremists can do and where they can go are still in their legal infancy.\nThe government concedes they will need to be properly targeted. It is still consulting with lawyers and community groups to try to get the balance right.\nPolice estimate at least 700 people from the UK have travelled to support or fight for jihadist organisations in Syria and Iraq, such as the so-called Islamic State, and the government believes tackling non-violent extremism is key to stemming the flow of people.\nParents of children aged under 16 have had the power to request the cancellation of passports - even where a child has taken or hidden the actual document - since July.\nThat power is being extended to parents of 16 and 17-year-olds, allowing families to contact a passport office where officials will investigate their concerns before a final decision is taken by the home secretary.\nMrs May said the measure had only been used by \"a small number\" of parents since July, but it was part of a package of new powers that would help tackle extremism.\nShadow policing minister Jack Dromey said it was \"crucial we get the balance right\" and that Mr Cameron must \"be very careful not to use the language he used earlier in the summer that somehow the Muslim community is not standing up to terrorism\".\nLiberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said the announcements amounted to \"rhetoric that may well divide communities and make our job of working with those communities to find and isolate terrorists and potential terrorists that much harder\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "The home secretary has vowed to \"systematically confront and challenge extremist ideology\" as she detailed new curbs on those who \"spread hate\".", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

His wife had given birth to their first child, his son Leon's safe arrival coming only nine days ago after a four-day labour.\nThe question troubling his fans was what state of mind would he be in to face a challenger known for being a regular sparring partner of the legendary Manny Pacquiao?\nThe opening blows were fairly evenly shared, both fighters lively and aggressive, while in the second round Beltran had the champion pinned on the ropes for a spell, though Burns managed to take most of the Mexican's artillery on his arms.\nBurns promised he had learned from , principally in the way he had over-stretched to land blows on his reclining opponent, only to be caught on the counter.\nHis exertions in the third round, though, suggested he was still trying to blow the challenger away and he was caught several times with Beltran's left hook before using his jab to good effect.\nBeltran stepped up the pace in the fourth and had Burns reeling from two crunching lefts, the second wobbling the 30-year-old from Coatbridge.\nThe challenger, two years Burns's senior, was controlling the ring and he had the best of the exchanges in round five, though Burns, often on the back foot, had cleared his head and was occasionally getting through the Arizona-based fighter's guard.\nBurns continued to use the counter-attack, more out of necessity than choice, to inflict pain on Beltran. His reward was to land two excellent shots to Beltran's head in the closing stages of the sixth.\nThe home fighter's recovery continued into the seventh as he made good use of a quick left jab, right-cross combination.\nBut in the eighth round the champion was floored for the first time in three years with a sickening left hook to the head.\nBurns took the count of eight to gather his senses and to his credit had the guts to hang in there and land a peach of a left hook on Beltran's chin. Worryingly for Burns's camp, the challenger did not flinch.\nThe Scot's refusal to panic paid dividends in his bout against Gonzalez, when his opponent retired injured after nine rounds.\nSimilarly, he kept calm in this bout despite that knockdown and the pain in his jaw and gave his all in rounds nine and 10, without truly disrupting the forward momentum of Beltran.\nThe crowd feared that Burns might need a knockout in the final two rounds to retain his belt but the technical and tactical nous of Beltran made this seem a forlorn wish.\nAgain and again, the fans witnessed the wonderfully composed Mexican break Burns's increasingly erratic defences without risking a knockout blow himself.\nThe final round signalled more of the same, sporadic bursts by Burns merely interrupting the hail of leather-clad fists.\nBut when the MC announced a draw, Beltran sharply exited the ring while the home fans, though proud of their brave champion, squirmed at the result.\nOn the undercard, Edinburgh's Stephen Simmons lifted the WBC international cruiserweight silver championship title with a deserved unanimous points win over Germany's David Graf, though the Scot suffered a nasty cut under his left eye in the fifth round.\nScott Cardle, from Lytham St Annes, with plenty of home support from the Glaswegian side of his family, beat Fishburn's Gary Fox, taking a 79-73 points decision in their lightweight contest.\nLiverpool's 2010 Commonwealth Games silver medal winner Callum Smith dispatched Lithuanian super-middleweight Kirill Psonko in the first round.\nGlasgow's Jonathan Slowey, 22, made it 15 straight wins by outpointing his rangy Spanish opponent Angel Lorente. The unanimous decision of the three judges landed him the WBC international featherweight silver championship.\nGarnant's 25-year-old Prizefighter winner Chris Jenkins beat the French light-welterweight Laurent Ferra on points.\nIt was also at that weight that Lochend Boxing Club's Paul Appleby made a winning return to the ring 15 months after his defeat by John Simpson. The South Queensferry fighter emerged from a bruising six-rounder against Chesterfield's Lee Connolly with a 59-56 triumph, a touch harsh on the Englishman.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Mexico's Raymundo Beltran - and the bulk of a passionate Glasgow crowd - was left stunned as he departed the ring with only a draw after dominating Ricky Burns in the Scot's fourth defence of his WBO world lightweight title.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

It will apply in exceptional cases as all derogrations from the freedoms (of movement rules) should.\"\nMr Juncker pointed out that the then Labour government had had the option to introduce transitional controls on migration when countries such as Poland and Hungary entered the EU in 2004 but, unlike Germany, decided against doing so.\nOne of the most controversial decisions of Tony Blair's time in office, several former Labour ministers have since said it was a mistake and acknowledged the government hugely underestimated the number of people who would come to the UK.\nMr Juncker said \"as a result\" of that decision \"over the past decade, the UK attracted a record number of mobile EU citizens\". He added. \"In effect, we will enable the UK to use the safeguards mechanism to address the consequences of that decision.\"\nBut UKIP leader Nigel Farage, also speaking in the European Parliament, said the safeguards were totally insubstantial and would not allow the UK to reduce levels of annual net migration, which rose to 336,000 in the year to June 2015.\n\"We have an emergency brake on migrants benefits. Wow. It was supposed to be a total ban on migrants benefits for four years. So it is hardly an emergency brake, it is more of a handbrake turn.\"\nMr Farage said Mr Cameron would not be able to get any further concessions out of the EU and the forthcoming referendum on the UK's future in the EU would be a battle between \"vested self-interests and people power\".\nFormer Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt, who is now a leading MEP, suggested that if the UK voted to leave the EU, it would be a boost for Russia and China.\n\"I think Britain without Europe - ok it's a dwarf, let's be honest,\" he claimed.\n\"We Belgians, we know that we are dwarfs but maybe they're going to know it also. And at the other hand Europe without Great Britain, yes, doesn't count, is not a counterweight against China, against Russia, against the United States.\n\"It is Vladimir Putin, in fact, who wins in this game in the end because Putin likes a divided Europe.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Limiting in-work benefits to new EU arrivals will help tackle the effects of record migration to the UK since 2004, the EC's president has said.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

We know him well by now, he said. When he says something is guaranteed, that means there's some kind of trap coming up.\nIn nearby fields, mortars and multiple rocket launchers fired back at the rebels - providing cover for those still trying to leave Debaltseve.\nPresident Poroshenko says the withdrawal was planned and organised, but on the ground it looked like a hasty retreat in the face of overwhelming odds.\nThe withdrawal came after Russian President Vladimir Putin urged Ukraine's troops in Debaltseve to surrender.\nMr Putin is due to speak by telephone later on Wednesday to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and Mr Poroshenko, according to the French government.\nSpokesman Stephane Le Foll insisted the agreement announced last week by the four leaders to end the fighting in eastern Ukraine was not dead, and that progress had been made.\nInternational observers monitoring the truce have been unable to enter Debaltseve.\nThe city has become a key prize for rebels and government forces, as it sits on a strategic railway line linking the rebel-held cities of Donetsk and Luhansk.\nMost of its 25,000 population has been evacuated but about 7,000 civilians are still believed trapped by the fighting.\nThe ceasefire, which came into effect on Sunday, has been broadly observed elsewhere and some rebel heavy weaponry was said to have been withdrawn.\nThe UN says more than 5,600 people have been killed in the conflict, but there are fears the actual death toll could be much higher.\nFighting began in eastern Ukraine in April, a month after Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula.\nUkraine's pro-Western government says Russia is supporting the separatists with troops and weapons, but the Kremlin has consistently denied this.\nMinsk agreement: Key points\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "The Ukrainian president says his forces are making an \"organised\" withdrawal from the embattled town of Debaltseve.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The team then used 3D software to see structures not visible on the surface of the fossil.\n\"People like myself who are mad keen on creepy crawlies want to understand how very strange early arthropods relate to living ones,\" added Dr Edgecombe.\n\"By having access to the nervous system it allows us to study the evolutionary relationships of very ancient fossils using the same kind of information that we would use for living animals.\"\nCo-author, Xiaoya Ma, also from the Natural History Museum, said: \"It is very exciting to use new techniques to successfully reveal such a complete central nervous system from a 520-million-year old fossil, and in such detail.\"\nShe told the BBC's Science in Action programme that the high resolution of the reconstructed image allowed the team to see \"the concentrated neural structures in the head region\". They could also observe the segments of the brain associated with the claw-like appendages.\nThe fossil belongs to an extinct group of marine arthropods known as megacheirans, Greek for \"large claws\".\nTo infer the evolutionary relationships between species, the fields of palaeontology and neuroanatomy came together.\nNicholas Strausfeld was from the anatomy side of the team at the University of Arizona, US.\n\"We now know that the megacheirans had central nervous systems very similar to today's horseshoe crabs and scorpions,\" said Prof Strausfeld.\n\"This means the ancestors of spiders and their kin lived side by side with the ancestors of crustaceans in the Lower Cambrian.\"\nHe added that their prominent appendages were clearly used for grasping and holding.\n\"Based on their location, we can now say that the biting mouthparts in spiders and their relatives evolved from these appendages.\"\nThe team says they expect to find more fossils dating even further back, which will shed new light onto the ancestors of many of today's arthropods.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Scientists have discovered the best-preserved nervous system in an ancient fossil.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Finland is among the highest placed European countries.\nSuch comparisons have become increasingly influential - measuring pupils against the standards of international competitor countries.\nGlobalisation in the jobs market and the economy has seen education ministers wanting to benchmark pupils' achievement against current international rivals.\nSuch international rankings have also highlighted the educational strength underpinning the emerging economic powers in Asia.\nThese latest rankings bring together two major studies - the four-yearly Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the five-yearly Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS).\nThey reveal the continuing pattern of domination by a group of Asian education systems - South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong (such international comparisons include regional school systems as well as countries).\nBut the study, compiled by researchers at Boston College in the US, shows that England and Northern Ireland are performing strongly in the following group of European education systems.\nSource: TIMSS 2011\nIn maths, the study says England has been one of the most improved between 1995 and 2011. England remains in the global top 10 for maths - in 9th for primary and 10th for secondary.\nEngland has slipped in primary science tests, taken by 600,000 10 year olds - down to 15th place from 7th place in the last tests in 2007. There was also a dip for secondary science, taken by 14 year olds, down from 5th to 9th place.\nIn the literacy tests, taken by a sample of 325,000 primary school pupils, there was progress for England - up from 15th to 11th.\nA spokesman for Education Secretary Michael Gove said: \"These tests reflect progress between 2006 and 2011 and were taken only a year after the election.\n\"So to the limited extent the results reflect the effect of political leadership, Labour deserves the praise for the small improvement in reading and the blame for the stagnation in maths and the decline in science. The tests say nothing, good or bad, about what we have done.\"\nLabour's education spokesman, Stephen Twigg, said: \"These results show schools in England are some of the best in Europe - thanks to the hard work of teachers and pupils. The Labour government's reforms saw reading results improve thanks to better teaching, smaller class sizes and Labour's National Literacy Strategy.\nSource: TIMSS 2011\n\"However, we need to understand why East Asian countries out perform us in key skills - particularly science and maths.\"\nMr Twigg also highlighted the lower achievement for Sweden in reading - linking it to the free schools inspired by the Swedish education system.\nThere was a particularly strong performance for Northern Ireland - in 6th place for primary maths, which meant it was the highest ranking European school system.\nNorthern Ireland, taking part in these tests for the first time, is in 5th place for primary reading - in a top group alongside such education superpowers such as Finland and Hong Kong.\nIn terms of the proportion of pupils reaching the highest ability levels, Northern Ireland was even more successful, in 3rd place.\nThe maths study also ranked the \"safe and orderly\" levels of schools - and found Northern Ireland was at the top, with England in 14th place.\nThere was also a ranking of bullying for the primary maths study - with England having one of the worst records in Europe, in 30th place in terms of students' views of the levels of bullying.\nScotland and Wales did not take part in these rankings.\nSuch results show long-term trends, overlapping between different governments and education ministers. In England, the tests were taken under the current coalition government, but the pupils would have studied under the reforms of the previous Labour government.\nSource: PIRLS 2011\nResearchers say the factors linked to success are a supportive home background and schools which have good discipline and experienced and well-motivated teachers. They also mention negative social factors, such as too many older pupils having learning impaired by a lack of adequate sleep.\nThe maths study examined the availability of resources at home - such as books - with pupils in South Korea, Norway, Sweden and the US being the best equipped. Indonesia and Ghana had the least learning materials at home.\nThere is a broad pattern repeated across these tables, with a cluster of Asian, Pacific Rim, countries at the top, European and western countries in the upper and middle ranks, with countries in North Africa and the Middle East in the lower ranks.\nReport author and Boston College professor, Michael Martin, said that the success of the top-performing countries reflects the long-term investment - and shows the way for other developing countries to follow.\n\"Education is a multi-generational enterprise,\" he said.\n\"One thing you can learn from these is what's possible. That comes as a shock sometimes, what students in other countries can actually do and the gap sometimes between what your students are achieving and what students in other countries are achieving,\" said Prof Martin.\nThere are other international rankings - but these also show a similar picture at the top of the table, with education systems such as South Korea, Hong Kong, Finland and England among the highest performers.\nIn global league tables assembled by Pearson last month, Finland and South Korea were top, with England in 6th place.\nThe less expected success of the TIMSS and PIRLS rankings will be the high performance of Russia, which has a place in all their top 10s.\nAnother prominent international ranking, the PISA tests run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, has shown a strong performance for Chinese education systems, including Shanghai and Hong Kong.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Asian countries have taken top places in global school rankings for maths, science and reading, with England and Northern Ireland among high performers.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

So what are the key legal questions?\nParliament has already rejected military intervention in Syria, in 2013. Ministers say circumstances have changed since then (notably with the rise of IS) and that they would only proceed this time with the backing of Parliament. But this is not technically necessary. Although it has become convention since the 2003 Iraq war, there is no legal requirement for Parliamentary approval for military action.\nMinisters say they would not proceed without a Commons vote - but they believe they have the authority, under international law, to intervene. Last month, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said there was \"no legal bar\" to the UK operating in Syria. In September, David Cameron suggested the UK could legally take military action in Syria without a request from President Assad, saying the Syrian president is \"illegitimate\".\nThe UK is already carrying out air strikes on IS targets in Iraq. The UK says that as the Iraqi government requested intervention, this provides a \"clear and unequivocal legal basis\" for the military action. But no such request has been received from the Syrian government, and the UK sees the regime as illegitimate in any case. This means the legal arguments around intervention in Syria would be shaped by the complexities and conflicting interpretations of international law.\nThe UN Charter bans \"the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state\" unless used in self-defence or authorised by a UN resolution. Those are the two \"classic justifications\" for military action, Prof Philippe Sands QC of University College London told the BBC.\nA UN resolution is unlikely given Russian opposition, leaving the option of self-defence. This would require ministers to show military action was needed to prevent attacks on the UK or its citizens emanating from Syria. Alternatively, the self-defence argument could be used in relation to Iraq, which has already requested military assistance. This is the argument used by the United States, which is carrying out air strikes in Syria.\nAs to whether this would work, \"we simply do not know enough about the facts\" to say definitely whether the self-defence argument is justified, says Prof Sands. He believes it would be \"a bit of a stretch\" on the basis of what is publicly available, adding that the UK appears to have \"no strategy and no clear basis of information to explain to the public what it is doing, and why it believes it is entitled in law to use force by way of self-defence\".\nAnother option would be to justify the action on humanitarian grounds. This was the basis of the government's case for intervention in 2013, when it focused on the possible use of chemical weapons by Syrian President Assad. Its legal position, published in August 2013, set out the three conditions that had to be met:\n\"This puts the evidential bar both high and wide,\" BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman wrote at the time.\nThe question would be whether the changed circumstances, with IS - also known as ISIS - militants controlling parts of Syria and fighting against government forces, would meet the test.\nDr Jonathan Eyal, international director at the Royal United Services Institute, told the BBC there would be a \"quite plausible case\".\n\"Given the behaviour we know of ISIS, the circumstances of the horrific civil war in Syria, it's not difficult to construct a case that the humanitarian danger is grave and is immediate,\" he says.\nAs well as the UN rules, \"customary international law\" has been established over the years.\nOne option would be the right of \"hot pursuit\" of IS across borders, Dr Eyal says. Given that Iraq has requested international assistance in the fight against IS militants, the UK could argue that unless it can pursue them into Syria, they could \"seek refuge across the border and the situation will never end\", he says.\nThis argument is strengthened by the inability of the Syria government to control its own territory he says, adding that hot pursuit is \"not an argument that lawyers are very comfortable with, but it has been made before\".\nNo. Both the hot pursuit and humanitarian intervention arguments are \"controversial and contested\", Dr Eyal says, with governments accused of \"abusing the system\".\nSome legal experts are not convinced any air strikes without specific Security Council authorisation would be consistent with international law, a Commons briefing paper points out.\nSort of. A US-led coalition is already carrying out air strikes in Syria. Last month it emerged UK pilots had been embedded with coalition forces and conducting air strikes over Syria against IS. Amid criticism from Labour, Mr Fallon said embedding forces was \"standard practice\" and their engagement was not a \"British military operation\".\nVery much so. The government's insistence on securing Parliamentary approval means it will be MPs' interpretations of these intricacies of international law that will be key.\nLast time MPs debated military intervention in Syria, opposition from backbench Conservatives and Ed Miliband-led Labour was enough to defeat the government.\nHowever, MPs have since overwhelmingly backed action in Iraq, where the target was IS militants. Since those votes, the make-up of the Commons has changed, with the Conservatives holding a majority.\nThe identity of Labour's next leader - with surprise frontrunner Jeremy Corbyn certain to oppose any air strikes - is another complicating factor.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "One of the big questions facing MPs after the summer recess could be whether to authorise military intervention against so-called Islamic State (IS) extremists in Syria.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Most animals do.\"\nThe first animal to reveal its UV sensitivity was the reindeer. And, as the researchers explained, reindeers' avoidance of the power lines running across the Arctic tundra was part of the inspiration for this project.\nDr Nicholas Tyler, the other lead author, said it had been assumed that rather than avoiding the power cables themselves, animals steered clear of passages cut in forested areas before pylons were installed.\n\"Forest animals will not cross clear-cuts,\" he said.\n\"But for us in the Arctic, avoidance of power lines is difficult to explain - there are no trees, yet the reindeer still avoid the power lines.\"\nThe animals keep as much as 5km (3 miles) from either side of the cables.\n\"This has been a mystery,\" Dr Tyler added. \"We have now come up with a mechanism [to explain it].\"\nThis research required a detailed understanding of animal vision, which was where Prof Jeffery came in.\nHaving discovered in 2011 that reindeer eyes were sensitive to UV light, Prof Jeffery went on to study the eyes of almost 40 mammal species, revealing all were UV-sensitive.\nSince, as the researchers added, coronas \"happen on all power lines everywhere\", the avoidance of the flashes could be having a global impact on wildlife.\n\"It has always been assumed that power lines - masts and the cables strung between them - were passive structures standing immobile in the terrain, and therefore inoffensive for animals,\" said Dr Tyler.\n\"As a result of this work, we now consider them as chains of flashing light stretching across the tundra in the winter darkness, and that's why the animals find them so offensive.\"\nThe random and unpredictable nature of these flashes were particularly problematic, he added, as the animals could not easily adapt to them.\nProf Jeffery said he hoped power companies would now consider ways to address the issue.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Animals around the world could be scared away from power cables because these give off UV flashes invisible to humans, scientists have said.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Probably because of the way it was driven.\"\nJoseph Fetter, who was driving behind Rhodri's car, said he was driving consistently around five car lengths behind and no racing had taken place, but he had seen Rhodri's brake lights come on several times.\n\"I think it was inexperience that made him lose control,\" he said. \"I wasn't pushing him on - I didn't know the road at all. It was dark.\"\nPassengers in some of the other vehicles said Rhodri was not overtaking but did lose control of his car on the bend, swerving from one side of the road to the other.\nBut survivor Emlyn Williams, who was in the other car involved in the crash along with friend Mrs Challis, disputed some of the evidence.\n\"The car was coming down by a bend. I saw another car overtaking it. The car hit me, that was it,\" he said.\n\"The only thing I knew was a bang, the windscreen broke and the airbag came out.\n\"I tried to get out and see to Mrs Challis. I went to the other car. It was quiet, silent. There was no opportunity to steer out of the way.\"\nDrivers and passengers in vehicles travelling in the direction of Merthyr Tydfil described in police statements seeing the cars leave a lay-by at Storey Arms minutes before the collision.\nThe inquest was told they pulled out too quickly and too close to each other. One witness said: \"Boy racers. It's obvious they were on a mission.\"\nDyfed-Powys Police Insp Gary Jones told the inquest messages found on mobile phones showed those in the convoy had discussed speed.\nOne read: \"It's madness. Everyone's racing there are 9 cars\" while another read \"why would I want to go along cars with turbos - I'll be the slowest there\".\nPC David Stacey, who investigated what had happened, said it was \"like nothing I had seen in 20 years service. It was a distressing scene\".\nHe told the inquest he believed what Mr Williams had seen was Rhodri's car out of control, possibly caused by approaching the unmarked bend at too high a speed and braking in the turn, but not overtaking.\nRhodri and Corey were pronounced dead at the scene while Alesha and Mrs Challis died at Prince Charles Hospital, Merthyr.\nThe inquest heard new road signs had since been put in place on that section of road but the coroner recommended that signage should warn about the upcoming bend.\nIn a statement, Rhodri's family described their son as \"the child every parent would dream of\", adding: \"Our hearts have been ripped out, and nothing is the same.\"\nThe family said they would like to see lessons learned and for young drivers to be made to realise the implications of serious car accidents in the same way as those who are caught speeding do.\nThe family also called for more rigorous conditions to be placed on new drivers.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "A fatal combination of inexperience, speed and peer pressure led to the deaths of four people in a two-car crash, an inquest has heard.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

You get to meet thousands of interesting visitors and everybody's here to have a good day out.\"\nMr Smith said since 1902 the railway, which has always included a passenger service, had only stopped operating once - during World War Two.\n\"Pretty much everything in the country shut down,\" he said.\n\"As part of the war effort it stopped operation, but I'm told the day the war ended they steamed the engine up and blew the whistle all the way down the line.\n\"Someone said that was their first memory of the railway.\"\nSimon Cowan, carriage and locomotive painter, is trained as a fireman and a driver.\n\"The main thing is to make things from scratch, to replace items which are no longer made,\" he said.\n\"So we copy them faithfully and make them all in the old fashioned way and then I pass these skills on to other people, it's a bit like a big museum.\n\"It's the older people, I'm one of them, who have grown up in that specialist knowledge, that area, passing those skills on - because I will get to the point where I can't do this any more.\n\"I show people how to paint, it's a lovely way of seeing people develop, so when I go on holiday I'm not thinking 'gosh what are they doing to my paint shop'.\n\"We also put them out on the trains as firemen and guards, and we teach them as much as we can.\n\"Carriages are painted with 24 carat gold leaf and they go 'wow that must be so expensive', well no it's so wafer thin.\n\"We show them how to make a tracing of a word and get the typeface correct and show them how to apply the lettering on to a piece of wood, and then we'll use this varnish and paint that on to there, and when the varnish is sticky put the gold leaf on and peel it off and 'wow, that's great'.\n\"Then I'll say 'give us your thumb' and put a bit of varnish on, just let that dry, and gold leaf their thumb and they think it's hilarious - but then they've learnt how to do it.

Rooney's addition comes after Calvin Zola failed to become a regular starter following his arriving from Burton Albion in the summer.\nManager Derek McInnes will hope that Shaleum Logan or Alan Tate, who had arrived from Brentford and Swansea City respectively, prove to be as classy in defence as Michael Hector, who has returned to the Reading bench after his loan at Pittodrie.\nIn: Adam Rooney, forward (Oldham Athletic). Loan: Alan Tate, defender (Swansea City); Shaleum Logan, defender (Brentford)\nOut: Gregg Wylde, midfielder (St Mirren); Scott Ferries, midfielder (Ross County), Chris Clark, midfielder (Cove Rangers); Craig Duguid, defender.

However, the big test will be whether a player who was in and out of the Wolves side in England's League One can make the step up to the Champions League stage next season.\nStefan Johansen should prove to be an adequate replacement for Joe Ledley after the Wales international's departure to Crystal Palace once the Norway midfielder settles in Glasgow.\nIn: Leigh Griffiths, forward (Wolves, undisclosed); Stefan Johansen, midfielder (Stromgodset, \u00a32m); Holmbert Aron Fridjonsson (Fram Reykjavic, \u00a3150,000)\nOut: Joe Ledley, midfielder (Crystal Palace, undisclosed); Mo Bangura, forward.

However, the troubled Scotland striker was kept out of the side by a combination of Nadir Ciftci, the young Turk who arrived from Breda, and the emerging talent of 17-year-old Ryan Gauld.\nFarid El Alagui, who was so prolific with Falkirk, looks like an able replacement for Goodwillie and the on-loan Brentford striker scored in only his second United start.\nIn: Loan: Farid El Alagui, forward (Brentford); Curtis Good, defender (Newcastle United)\nOut: Ryan Ferguson, midfielder (Brechin City); Ross Smith, defender (Peterhead).

To expect a 20-year-old, no matter how talented, to make up the deficit created by a start-of-season 15-point penalty is too much to ask.\nMany Hearts fans had seen Rudi Skacel as a potential saviour, but the veteran midfielder struggled to make an impact with Dundee United before being released in the summer and the Scottish Professional Football League rejected the club's request to sign the Czech in any case.\nIn: Loan: Paul McCallum, forward (West Ham United)\nOut: Adam King, midfielder (Swansea City, undisclosed); Alan Combe, goalkeeper (remains as coach)\nSummer signing report card\nPass: Danny Wilson, defender (Liverpool)\nKey arrivals: Almost uniquely outside of Celtic, Hibs actually forked out a substantial transfer fee to take James Collins from Swindon Town in the summer. However, the Irishman's failure, along with fellow striking additions Paul Heffernan and the now-departed Rowan Vine, to come anywhere near matching the goal rate of former loanee Leigh Griffiths perhaps more than anything led to Pat Fenlon's departure as manager.\nNew boss Terry Butcher says it will be the summer before he is able to reshape the squad in the way he wants, so for now he is having to hope that Danny Haynes, on loan from Notts County, or Sunderland teenager Duncan Watmore will provide the extra goalscoring spark. Meanwhile, on-loan Arsenal defender Daniel Boateng will be aiming for more game time than he achieved at Swindon Town and Oxford United.\nIn: Loan: Daniel Boateng, defender (Arsenal); Danny Haynes, forward (Notts County); Duncan Watmore, forward (Sunderland)\nOut: Rowan Vine, forward (Morton); Fraser Mullen, defender (Raith Rovers); Tim Clancy, defender.

However, the Finland international is now 30 and has since had anonymous spells with Russia outfit Rubin Kazan and in Khazakhstan with Kairat Almaty.\nDavid Moberg Karlsson is only 19, but the on-loan Sunderland winger has first-team experience with IFK Gothenburg that should help him make an impression in the Scottish Premiership.\nIn: Alexie Eremenko, midfielder (Kairat Almaty). Loan: David Moberg Karlsson, (Sunderland); Vitalijs Maksimenko, defender (Brighton & Hove Albion)\nOut: Gabriel Reuben, midfielder (Waasland-Beveren); Rabiu Ibrahim, midfielder; Kyle Jacobs, midfielder (Livingston); Mark Stewart, forward (Derry City); Gary Fisher, midfielder (East Fife).Loan: James Fowler, midfielder (Cowdenbeath); Jude Winchester, midfielder (Cliftonville)\nSummer signing report card\nPass: Craig Samson, goalkeeper (St Mirren); Sean Clohessy, defender (Southend United); Barry Nicholson, midfielder (Fleetwood Town); Jackson Irvine, midfielder (Celtic, loan)\nJury out: Antonio Reguero, goalkeeper (Inverness Caledonian Thistle); Conor Brennan, goalkeeper (Leicester City); Darren Barr, defender (Heart of Midlothian); Ismael Bouzid, defender (Alger); Michael Gardyne, forward (Dundee United)\nFail: Caoimhin Bonner, defender (Derry City); Kyle Jacobs, midfielder (Livingston); Mark Stewart, forward (Dundee)\nKey arrivals: Motherwell manager Stuart McCall had the best success rate of any Scottish Premiership manager during the summer. Which, in addition to a budget made tighter by an early Scottish Cup exit, perhaps explains why he was also the least active in January.\nHis priority was the extension of winger Lionel Ainsworth's loan from Rotherham United and retaining striker Henri Anier, who has now made a permanent switch from Viking Stavanger. Neither Anier, nor fellow summer arrival John Sutton, has managed to match individually the scoring rate of Michael Higdon, who left for Nijmegen. However, as a partnership, with 18 goals between them, they are well on their way to surpassing the total of 31 reached last season by the Englishman and Anier's departed Estonia team-mate, Henrik Ojamaa.\nIn: Loan to permanent: Henri Anier, forward (Viking Stavanger)\nOut: Loan ended: Dan Twardzik, goalkeeper (Dundee). Loan: Bob McHugh, forward (Queen of the South); Adam Cummins, defender (Dundee)\nSummer signing report card\nPass: Gunnar Nielsen, goalkeeper (Silkeborg); Stephen McManus, defender (Middlesbrough); Iain Vigurs, midfielder (Ross County); John Sutton, forward (Heart of Midlothian); Lionel Ainsworth, midfielder (Rotherham United); Henri Anier, forward (Viking Stavanger)\nJury out: Fraser Kerr, defender (Birmingham City); Paul Lawson, midfielder (Ross County); Ben Hall, midfielder (Dungannon Swifts)\nKey arrivals: The reviews of Partick Thistle on their return to Scotland's top flight have generally read: \"Nice play, shame about the finishing\". So in has come Lyle Taylor, who manager Alan Archibald witnessed terrorising Scottish Championship defences while with Falkirk before heading for Sheffield United. Three goals in his first two games showed promise, but none in his next four suggests the Englishman will need more creative help from a midfield bolstered by three loan signings - Prince Buaben, Chris Erskine and George Moncur - who arrived just before the January deadline.\nIn: Lee Mair, defender (St Mirren). Loan to permanent: Gary Fraser, midfielder (Bolton Wanderers). Loan: Lyle Taylor, forward (Sheffield United); Prince Buaben, midfielder (Carlisle United); George Moncur, midfielder (West Ham United); Chris Erskine, midfielder (Dundee United)\nOut: John Baird, forward (Raith Rovers); Hugh Murray, midfielder (Dumbarton); Mark McGuigan, forward (Albion Rovers); Mark Kerr, midfielder (Queen of the South); Ross Forbes, midfielder (Dunfermline Athletic).

His summer signings with previous Scottish top-flight experience having proved more successful than the influx from the Netherlands, Adams in January turned to the English market.\nOn-loan Cardiff City midfielder Filip Kiss has already proved his worth with four goals, even if he blotted his copybook with a red card at the weekend. As has Blackburn Rovers defender Yann Songo'o, who had added two strikes of his own.\nIn: Erik Cikos, defender (Slovan Bratislava); Yoann Arquin, forward (Notts County); Evangelos Ikonomou, defender (Veria); Scott Ferries, midfielder (Aberdeen).

After Murray Davidson was ruled out for the rest of the season late in January, manager Tommy Wright swiftly changed his targets to bring in two midfielders - Mark Davies and James Dunne.\nHowever, most Saints fans appear to have concerns about a central defence that was not bolstered during the January window.\nIn: Chris Iwelumo, forward (Scunthorpe United); Wayde Joyce, midfielder (Barnsley); Michael O'Halloran, forward (Bolton Wanderers); Fisayo Adarabioyo, midfielder (Birmingham City).

Adam Campbell, Josh Magennis and, in particular, Gregg Wylde have already impressed and should increase the Buddies' threat going forward.\nThe experienced Eric Djemba-Djemba should help protect the back four - and they might need it considering the Paisley squad has shed three defenders without replacing them.\nIn: Eric Djemba-Djemba, midfielder (Partizan Belgrade); Gregg Wylde, midfielder (Aberdeen).

And as the country has fallen into recession, crime has boomed.\nThe government has not made national homicide rates public in more than a year, but independent organisations such as the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence say the rates are increasing.\nThe NGO's annual report for 2014 recorded 24,980 violent deaths - equating to 82 murders per 100,000 inhabitants, up from 79 in 2013.\nThose are figures for a country at war.\nEven the police have become victims of crime, as 268 policemen were killed in the country in 2014.\nA recent poll by the Observatory on Organised Crime reported that 51% of Venezuelans say murders had taken place near where they lived.\n\"As insecurity is not solved - and far from it, it only gets worse - people had got used to the problem as part of their life without any hope of a real solution nor genuine offers from politicians,\" says Luis Vicente Leon, chief executive of Datanalisis.\n\"Since people have got used to insecurity, new problems that get worse like shortages or inflation tend to be more mentioned as their main concern.\"\nBut there might also be a psychological reason why shortages have become such an \"obsession\" for Venezuelans.\n\"Overall, at the precise moment when you stop finding a product, it becomes more precious than it used to be,\" says American psychologist Eldar Shafir, co-author of Scarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So Much.\n\"Think of it as a work of art that was stolen and when it is found the price is three times higher.\n\"When you're not able to get something, it becomes a challenge that captures your attention, to the point of getting obsessed with it and sacrificing other things that are on the periphery, such as exercising or playing with your children.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Marta doesn't need to go shopping today, because her fridge is filled with all the products her family requires.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Graeme Shinnie and Kenny McLean were commanding.\nThey lived in their faces defensively and showed plenty offensively. The feeling was that Aberdeen had to take the lead to make a true fight of this final and that is precisely what they did.\nHaving shipped three early goals to Celtic in their last meeting, the Dons changed the narrative.\nFrom a Niall McGinn corner, Hayes came round the blindside of Leigh Griffiths and smashed a volley past goalkeeper Craig Gordon and beyond Kieran Tierney on the line.\nIt was a goal of quality and a goal that electrified the huge Aberdeen support.\nCeltic are champions, though, and their true selves emerged only two minutes later when Aberdeen unwisely stood off Armstrong, who thumped in the equaliser low to Lewis's left.\nTwo early goals and the intensity only cranked up from there. Midway through the half, there was controversy.\nJayden Stockley - selected up front ahead of Adam Rooney - swung an arm into Tierney's face and the young Celtic full-back immediately signalled that he was in bother.\nBlood poured from his mouth and, after treatment, he had to leave the field.\nStockley has a reputation for over-zealous use of his arms and elbows and was deeply fortunate not to see red for a fourth time this season. He claimed it was accidental, but Celtic were having none of it. They were incensed.\nCallum McGregor shifted to left-back and Rogic came into the final and things went up another level.\nGordon made a double save in quick order and then made another from a Stockley header.\nCeltic were rattled, they were totally unable to get a hold of the game in the face of the Dons' aggressive edge.\nIt was Celtic, however, who should have gone ahead just before the break when a delicious Griffiths delivery was put over from point-blank range by Scott Sinclair.\nThe toe-to-toe nature of the contest carried on brilliantly. Griffiths and Sinclair went close then Aberdeen swept downfield on a breakaway and a priceless chance was wasted.\nHayes had mugged McGregor down the right and, with McLean running free in the box, all they had to do was get their communication right and a goal was certain.\nThey didn't. Hayes hit his pass slightly behind McLean and the midfielder couldn't hook it in. Agony for Aberdeen.\nCeltic then moved up a gear and now it was the Dons pinned on the ropes. Lewis pushed a Patrick Roberts shot on to his post.\nFrom the resulting corner, Celtic's Mikael Lustig tugged the ball just wide. The game opened up as wide as the Clyde.\nAberdeen's Ash Taylor headed away from under his own crossbar, Dedryck Boyota headed just over, Gordon made a fine save from Shinnie and then it was Lewis's turn again, saving wonderfully from Griffiths. Lewis was immense for the Dons.\nAs the final wore on, Celtic took an ever-tightening grip.\nRodgers' side pressed and pressed and a tiring Aberdeen threw their bodies in front of shots to keep alive. Their scrambling defence was constant and heroic.\nBut it wasn't enough. With all at Hampden steeling themselves for extra-time, Rogic ran at Aberdeen down the right, going past the utterly jaded Andrew Considine and slamming his shot low under Lewis. Extraordinary.\nThe heartbroken Dons had made it a mighty battle, but Celtic showed their incomparable will and their domestic greatness.\nThe history makers had done it again. A treble won.

Also from Spain, Gamesa has opted for Glasgow as a research base, while looking at Dundee for manufacturing and logistic support.\nThe biggest commitment so far is from Doosan Power Systems, a subsidiary of the vast Doosan conglomerate based in South Korea. It is new into the wind turbine business, though it's not new to green energy research, as a partner with Scottish & Southern Energy on early stages of commercialising carbon capture and storage.\nThe research and development centre comes first, with 500 jobs to follow in a turbine manufacturing plant. So far Scotland's only had one such plant, near Campbeltown, and it's had a troubled couple of years, with three owners. So Doosan's statement of intent is a sign that the green jobs potential and hopes may be moving towards reality.\nThe jobs announcements were made by both companies, who were visited by First Minister Alex Salmond.\nDoosan intends to locate its research and development centre for renewables at its current site at Westway in Renfrew, creating up to 200 jobs.\nThe Korean firm is also in talks with the business development agency, Scottish Enterprise, to set up manufacturing and assembly facilities in Scotland - its favoured location for wind turbine development and production.\nDoosan expects its offshore wind plans in Scotland to create up to 1,700 new jobs.\nThe firm aims to directly recruit about 700 new staff, with a further 1,000 employed in associated supply companies.\nIn a separate announcement, Steel Engineering, which is also based at Westway in Renfrew, said it aimed to create 120 jobs by expanding its business servicing a range of clean energy sectors, including offshore wind, wave and tidal power.\nThe firm is getting a \u00c2\u00a31.8m government grant towards the \u00c2\u00a33m investment.\nSteel Engineering is also in talks with Skills Development Scotland about developing a training school with Anniesland College in Glasgow.\nThis would aim to provide training tailored to the latest fabrication techniques, and welding procedures required by the renewables industry.\nMr Salmond said both announcements were \"great news for Renfrew and for the wider Scottish economy\".\nHe described the Doosan initiatives as \"another great stride forward for the renewables industry in Scotland - which is now the chosen destination for three energy engineering giants to design their next generation of turbines to service the global offshore wind industry\".\nThe first minister added: \"Scotland also plays a key role in the energy industry supply chain and Steel Engineering are an excellent example of how Scottish companies with great experience servicing the offshore oil and gas industry have been building the renewables side of their business.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Expansion plans by two engineering firms could create 820 new jobs in Scotland's renewable energy sector.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

We have always had a steady flow of JLR workers.\n\"The big problem is the lack of parking round here. They are along the pavements, the grass verges, sometimes it's difficult to get into the side roads.\"\nJulie Jones, who works at Trev's Hairdressers, also in Hob's Moat Road, said: \"The parking is ridiculous - diabolical.\n\"There is nowhere for us to go because all the Land Rover workers are there.\"\nIn 2005, MG Rover based at Longbridge, less than 10 miles from Solihull, went into administration. About 14,000 people employed by the Rover group were based at the site.\nBut Ms Eade said she did not believe Solihull would suffer a similar fate and collapse if JLR's fortunes changed in the future.\n\"The automotive industry has learnt lessons from MG Rover,\" she said.\n\"They are not as heavily reliant on one customer now and if you are a designer you probably work for JLR, Mini, JCB, Ford.\n\"I don't think the bubble will burst for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Swindon is known by some as \"Honda Town\" and Detroit as \"Motor City\".", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Those are our values.\"\nDonald Trump's lawyers did not make their case. In fact, according to three Ninth Circuit judges, they didn't even really try to make their case. Rather than explaining why the temporary travel ban was needed, the administration argued that the president's authority on immigration was so sweeping that they didn't have to explain why the order was necessary.\nAccording to the court, the government was unable to say why Mr Trump's ban addressed a pressing national security threat that a temporary stay of the order would worsen. The lawyers for the challenging states, on the other hand, convinced the judges that re-imposing the order at this point would create further chaos by infringing on the due process rights of those on US soil, regardless of their immigration status.\nBy issuing a unanimous, unsigned opinion, the judges avoid accusations of partisan bias, as one of the three was a Republican appointee.\nMr Trump tweeted a sharp \"SEE YOU IN COURT\" following the decision - but which court?\nAn appeal to the Supreme Court seems likely, although a better move for the president may be to fight in the lower court until Judge Neil Gorsuch joins a conservative majority on the bench.\nThe executive order, at the end of Mr Trump's first week in office, had sparked protests and confusion as people were stopped at US borders.\nThen a week later, a federal judge in Seattle issued a temporary restraining order that stopped the ban in its tracks, after Washington state and Minnesota sued.\nThe Justice Department appealed to the 9th Circuit in San Francisco, which heard oral arguments this week.\nLawyers representing the US government argued that the ban was a \"lawful exercise\" of presidential authority.\nBut the two US states said the ban had harmed universities in their states and discriminated against Muslims.\nThe appeal judges did not rule on the constitutionality or the merits of the law, just on the question of its reinstatement.\nThe lower court in Seattle must still debate its merits and there are other legal challenges across the country.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "A US appeals court has rejected President Donald Trump's attempt to reinstate his ban on visitors from seven mainly Muslim countries.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

How like an early human foetus, they appear.\n\"This is something you see time and time again in vertebrates, not just with mammals,\" says Richard Sabin, the Natural History Museum's top whale expert.\n\"You see these similarities in the early developmental stages and it's really not until you're halfway through the gestation - which  for a humpback whale is around 11 months - that you start to see the things that make that foetus characteristically the species that it is.\"\nRichard has a remarkable sequence of seven humpback foetuses that he's going to put on display for the NHM's major summer exhibition on cetaceans.\nThey go from what is essentially just a ball of cells that's perhaps only a few weeks old, all the way through to a specimen that appears to be a perfect humpback in miniature.\nThis larger foetus, about half a metre in length, is probably seven to eight months into the gestation period. It has everything you would expect to see in a humpback, including those long, tell-tale pectoral flippers with their nobbly tubercles.\nThe specimens were collected at the beginning of the 20th Century by scientists who had been sent to the Antarctic to gather data on the activities of the whaling fleets.\nTheir role was to understand the biology, the movements, and the ecology of whales - to appreciate the status of stocks so that the commercial returns could be maximised. It's an awkward feeling knowing that these foetuses were taken from harpooned pregnant humpbacks.\nSomehow you have to console yourself with the recognition that the acquired data was ultimately what shut down that bloody industry.\n\"There is a story with every specimen and it may not be a very comfortable story, but it is something we have to acknowledge,\" says Richard.\n\"The thing to remember is that the data we get from these specimens we actively use for marine conservation purposes now.\"\nJust this past week, a Swiss-led team used old whaling data to show how species had shrunk in size in the 40 years prior to the stocks collapsing. This trend signal, the team said, could be used to warn of imminent disaster in other hunted wildlife groups.\nWhat have we learned from foetuses, specifically? A lot it seems about evolutionary biology.\n\"One thing we see in these humpbacks is the development of tooth buds at around four-to-five months into gestation. They're then reabsorbed to allow the baleen to start to develop,\" explains Richard. The baleen are the keratin plates that hang from the upper-jaw and filter the humpbacks' prey.\n\"So, we know from the study of these foetuses, from an evolutionary developmental perspective, that there was a time when all cetaceans were toothed and that baleen are a relatively recent development. And we've only just found the fossils that back that up.\"\nThe whales exhibition is due to open on 14 July, the day after the NHM re-opens its front entrance. The Hintze Hall has been remodelled. Its emblematic diplodocus (\"Dippy\") dinosaur is being replaced by a blue whale skeleton that will hang from the ceiling (Plot spoiler: I've had a sneak peek already and it looks spectacular).\nSo, it's certainly a timely moment to highlight the contribution of cetaceans to life on Earth.\nMore than 100 specimens from the London museum's collections are being set up in the institution's Waterhouse Gallery.\nThe exhibition will impress upon visitors the huge diversity of whales, dolphins and porpoises. It will explain their relatively short evolutionary journey, from being land animals 50 million years ago to becoming the well-adapted ocean-dwellers we know today.\nAnd it will describe how they move, how they breathe, and how some echolocate to find their prey. It still astounds me that whales can communicate over many hundreds of kilometres.\n\"We want people to realise that as well as being mammals like us, they also have complex culture like us,\" says Richard. \"This is a very new area of study that has accelerated in just the past 10 years through observations, through genetic information and the data coming from museum specimens.\"\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "It's a curious thing to see a group of early whale foetuses up close - to see beings so small that have the potential to become so big.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Almost immediately, outlets including Xinhua news agency released a prepared statement describing the decision as \"illegal and invalid\".\n\"China has repeatedly declared that the arbitration tribunal does not have jurisdiction; China neither accepts nor recognises it,\" Xinhua said.\nIt then released a government statement saying China \"has territorial sovereignty and maritime rights over the South China Sea islands\" and \"resolutely opposes a few countries' illegal violations\" - a reference to the US and its allies in the region.\nBut it hinted at a way forward, saying there is potential for China to enter into \"joint developments\" in order to \"achieve win-win results\" and peace and stability in the South China Sea.\nState-run CCTV cited the foreign ministry's view that the tribunal proceedings were \"null and void\".\nIt featured British, Iranian, Pakistani and Lebanese experts who questioned the verdict. Oxford academic Antonios Tzanakopoulos told the TV that he did not find the tribunal's points \"fully convincing\".\nCCTV also hinted at possible negotiations with the Philippines. It showed former Filipino ambassador Alberto Encomienda saying American interference had triggered the case. He added: \"There's a lot we can do, not in terms of what China can do for us, but what we can do together for the region.\"\nThere was an immediate attempt to control online discussion in China.\nIn the minutes before the announcement, Sina Weibo's hashtag #SouthChinaSeaArbitration was number one in its top 10. Its landing page carried more than 170,000 posts.\nOnce the result was out, the hashtag disappeared from Sina's ranking.\nState media and its millions of followers - including Xinhua, People's Daily and CCTV - adopted a similarly-named hashtag, #SouthChinaSeaArbitrationCase. It quickly rose to number one in the ranking, with posts overwhelmingly dismissing the Hague ruling.\nMeanwhile, over at censorship-monitoring website Free Weibo, \"South China Sea\" became the most-censored term.\nThe press room was packed but the statement from Philippine Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay lasted just two minutes.\nIn four short paragraphs, he explained that experts were now analysing the ruling and called on all concerned to exercise \"constraint and sobriety\" at what he described as a \"milestone decision\".\nThere were no celebrations, hardly even a smile. And there's a reason for that.\nThis is not the same government that first brought this case to the Permanent Court of Arbitration three and a half years ago, in the aftermath of a standoff at Scarborough Shoal.\nTwo weeks ago, Rodrigo Duterte was sworn in as Philippine president. All the indications are that he is more willing to seek accommodation with the Chinese than his predecessor, Benigno Aquino.\nHere in Manila, many believe that the new president may have sought promises of Chinese investment, in return for a quiet, dignified response.\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

we've never been there before in the history of Nigerian cricket.\"\nMr Solebo, who first started playing cricket whilst at school in the UK, reckons that in a population of more than 170 million \"there must be a million or so followers of cricket in Nigeria quite easily\".\nHowever, not many of them are at Tafawa Balewa Square Cricket Oval next to Lagos' dilapidated old racecourse.\nBesides a few team members on the stand and a man barbecuing meat, only a small group watches from deckchairs under a nearby tree, keeping refreshed with drinks from a cool box.\nSome of them turn out to be former Nigerian internationals - stalwarts of the game, some of whom are updating a chat group of enthusiasts with the latest scores by mobile phone.\nFemi Solebo, Club Cricket Committee Lagos chair:\nI joke with them that if I don't fund them, they're going to come mug me\n\"In our time we didn't have as much exposure as the current national team does, we were restricted in playing in just the West African region,\" says Barnaby Ephraim, who now helps administer the game in Lagos.\nHe says it is the Lagos league, which was started more than 15 years ago, that has helped raise the profile of cricket and the opportunity to play it outside school and university.\nIt is also tempering attitudes that see the game as elitist and old fashioned, with some schools - even the established private ones - not seeing the sport as a priority.\nAnd Mr Solebo admits it is difficult to rival football as there are not the fans to warrant tickets that would pay for the upkeep of a turf pitch.\nThe ground the teams use is often rented out by the cash-strapped Nigerian Cricket Federation - and with upcoming elections, political rallies have recently been held here, playing havoc with the pitch, already like concrete after the dry Harmattan season.\nThe game is also expensive for players given the kit needed.\n\"With soccer, all you need is just one ball and then you're away,\" says the 45-year-old.\nBut he says whilst the league is sponsored by private individuals like him with a passion for the game, most of the 400 players in its two divisions are \"from the streets\".\nThe Ibeju Lekki club helps pay for either a player's education or vocational training - and subsidises kit and lunches.\nKunle Adegbola, Nigerian cricket captain:\nCricket is just evolving in Nigeria... in the next four to five years cricket will be out there like football\n\"Whatever it is they want to do, we'll fund that and insist that you can only be a member of this club if you have some kind of educational background - and that's what the other clubs try to do as well,\" says Mr Solebo, who runs a company that generates electricity.\n\"I joke with them that if I don't fund them, they're going to come mug me.\n\"Some of them are doing very well in university, some of them have left and are working now.\"\nA few of Lagos' cricketers have even gone professional, like Nigerian cricket captain Kunle Adegbola.\nThe towering 33-year-old has come to practise for his Foundation Cricket Club in the nets ahead of a game the next day.\nWhen the season ends in April in Lagos he will head off to London, where he has played for Burgess Park and Blackheath cricket clubs in the past.\nHe says with more awareness, spectators and sponsorship, he sees great things for Nigerian cricket.\n\"Cricket is just evolving in Nigeria...  in the next four to five years cricket will be out there like football,\" he says.\nBut the Lagosian cricketers know gaining such momentum will only be achieved with serious corporate sponsorship - which would be more likely if ongoing negotiations with a cable TV company bear fruit.\nSo far TV executives have been reluctant to go ahead as they would prefer a national league.\n\"But we say that we can take it in phases, adopt Lagos first and then you can open up,\" says Mr Ephraim, vice-chair of the Lagos State Cricket Association which is also trying to rejuvenate youth interest in cricket.\nHe says that unlike other states there are 35 schools in Lagos now playing cricket - with both boys and girls participating.\nIbeju Lekki player Endurance Ofem agrees junior involvement is key to putting cricket on a football footing.\nBut the former captain of the Nigerian side says offering national team players good welfare packages like those available to professional footballers is important too.\n\"If you do that, every youngster sees the reason to come and play cricket.\"\nFor Mr Solebo, competing with football is not the issue - it is the cricket that matters.\n\"It makes me very proud that our efforts give people joy every weekend - they come here, play with passion and it's fantastic.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Nigeria has produced its fair share of great sportsmen and women -

believers still bathe there today and Holywell has become known as the \"Lourdes of Wales\".\nIn 1138, Prior Robert of Shrewsbury moved the saint's remains to his abbey, later writing a \"Life\" - or biography - of Winefride, which was to prove instrumental in spreading her popularity.\nIn medieval times, she became the saintly equivalent of a superstar.\n\"Winefride, or Gwenfrewy as she is known in Welsh, is the only native female saint from Wales to have a substantial hagiographical dossier,\" says Prof Jane Cartwright, from the University of Wales Trinity St David.\n\"She was effectively a Welsh super saint whose cult extended beyond the Welsh border, since her relics were translated to Shrewsbury.\n\"She had two 12th Century Latin Lives and a 15th Century Welsh Life and she is one of the very few Welsh saints to make it into the Roman Martyrology.\nProf Cartwright, who is editing the medieval Welsh life of St Winefride for the Cult of Saints in Wales project, which aims to publish a digital edition of some 100 medieval Welsh-language texts on saints, adds: \"In a sense her cult united England and Wales and she was deemed suitable to be venerated by royalty,\"\nAt least six royal visitors - including Richard I, Edward IV and James II - have come to Holywell over the centuries.\nBy far the most famous visit was by Henry V in 1416, who, having placed himself under the spiritual protection of St Winefride before the previous year's Battle of Agincourt - where his 6,000 men faced a French army six times the size - walked from Shrewsbury to the shrine to thank her for his victory.\nThe precise date and route of the pilgrimage is unknown; in fact the only written record of it is in Latin, in the Chronicle of Adam of Usk so re-enacting the walk to commemorate its 600th anniversary has presented a challenge.\n\"There have been many attempts to work out the route,\" says walk organiser Ron Williams, from the Holywell Walkers are Welcome group.\n\"But when you think about it, there is only one way Henry V would have come.\n\"There weren't any roads except those the Romans had left and the Roman road comes to Llangollen from Shrewsbury, so that is most likely how he would have started off.\n\"On top of that he would have known that there was a Cistercian Abbey at Valle Crucis, so it's logical that he came there and if you look at a map, there's a direct line between Llangollen and Holywell so all we've done is put a walking route as near to that as possible.\n\"Of course we can't know it for sure but we think our route is more logical than those which have been put forward before.\n\"We have a good number of people walking the whole thing but we also want people to join in for the day so we've tried to make the walks easy to start and finish,\" adds Mr Williams.\nThe walkers - including one dressed as Henry V - will be welcomed into Holywell on 24 June.\nThe following day, the \"King\" will immerse himself in St Winefride's well.\nAn interdenominational service, an afternoon of talks on St Winefride and a medieval festival - complete with storytellers, jesters, archery and combat displays - are also part of the anniversary celebrations.\nIt is hoped the events will provide what festival organiser Mrs Owen claims is a \"much-needed\" boost for the Flintshire town.\n\"Holywell has been neglected,\" she said.\n\"It's like an unpolished diamond, a bit rough around the edges and it needs lots of little improvements.\n\"We want to get a much higher profile for the town with this - we want to really put it on the map.\"\nKerry Feather, project director of  St Winefride's Well, agreed: \"We want the town and the well to benefit from the attention.\n\"We currently have around 35,000 visitors every year and we really would like to boost that number.\n\"Some people come here for healing but others just find it a place of peace and sanctuary, somewhere to spend time, whether it's in prayer or thought, in an oasis of calm in the middle of a very busy world.\"\nThe organisers of this year's pilgrimage re-enactment also want it to have a lasting legacy - they have applied for Lottery funding for the creation of a new pilgrim's trail from Shrewsbury to Holywell, complete with waymarkers.\n\"Walking a pilgrim's trail is not just a walk, it's a different experience altogether,\" said Mr Williams.\n\"I'm not religious but you're walking in places where people have walked for centuries and it gets to you.\n\"You think, 'Why were they here, how did they get here, how did they feel?'\n\"It's quite an emotional experience and you get a real sense of connection to the history of the places along the route.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Six centuries ago Henry V walked from Shrewsbury to Holywell in Flintshire, to give thanks for his famous victory over the French at Agincourt.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

He was a hero to Rubens Barrichello, who grew up metres from the race track and forged his passion watching Senna there, before graduating to F1 a couple of years before his death, befriending him, and then taking up his mantle. Felipe Massa, another local boy, followed suit.\nThe fans know the glory days have long gone, that a Brazilian victory is as unlikely as a day without a traffic jam in one of the world's most crowded cities.\nBut still they come, packing the grandstands and singing and chanting from early in the day.\nWhat draws them there? A deep-seated passion for the sport, for one. The almost-certainty of a great sporting spectacle, for another.\nInterlagos has a knack for producing exciting races. Drama is synonymous with the track, not least because of its position at the business end of the season.\nIt is a claustrophobic place. The circuit winds around a natural amphitheatre, high on a hill, the sprawl of Sao Paulo both a backdrop and crushing in from all sides. The heavy humidity, and almost-permanent threat of rain, add to the atmosphere.\nIt feels locked in, and not just because of the cramped old paddock, a fraction of the size of anything Bernie Ecclestone finds acceptable these days.\nThe track is a splash of vibrant green in an ocean of concrete grey and smog brown; the city butting up against the perimeter fence, endless tower blocks filling the skyline.\nTwenty years ago, a favela sprawled up the hill all the way to the perimeter wall. There has been an attempt to spruce things up a bit, the old corrugated-roof shacks replaced by flats closest to the circuit, houses of naked breeze blocks a bit further down the road. But down at heel, to say the least, it remains.\nThere is an unmistakable edge. The road up to Interlagos is not a place for a stranger to linger.\nInside, the track feels like a haven. One of the shortest laps on the calendar somehow packs in a long straight - superb for overtaking - and a challenging sequence of long corners, the best the uphill double right-hander of Ferra Dura/Laranha and the fast downhill left of Mergulho. It's a great race track, with emphasis on the \"race\".\nThey are corners with a history - the new track is about half of the old one. Part of a previous era, it was a magnificent five miles of twists and turns, uphill and down, which started with two incredible, banked, high-speed left-handers, taken absolutely flat out by some, still visible outside the modern Turns One, Two and Three.\nIt all adds to the character of the place. Loud, intimidating, crazy, invigorating, rough-around-the-edges.

We are now actually having to pay to prop up a zombie currency we didn't even join.\"\nBut Mr Carswell appears to be in a minority - not so much in his views, as in his enthusiasm for making Europe a salient issue at this stage of the current parliament.\nTory memories of the bitter divisions of the past over Europe are still raw.\nThere is also a widespread recognition among Eurosceptic Tories that economic recovery, not Europe, must be the government's priority.\n\"So long as Britain is in an economic crisis\", says Tim Montgomerie, \"every Conservative MP knows that the focus must be on fixing that, and staying in coalition with the Liberal Democrats as a government of national unity.\"\nAnalysis is on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 17 October 20:30 BST and Sunday 23 October at 21:30 BST\nDownload the Analysis podcast\nListen via the Radio 4 website\nFollow Analysis on Facebook\nLast month a group of more than a hundred Conservative MPs met in the Thatcher Room of the House of Commons to debate a European strategy.\nThe meeting's convener, the young MP for Camborne, Redruth and Hayle, and former Cameron aide George Eustice, said the group would be looking for \"new thinking\" on Europe, not campaigning for a referendum on British withdrawal.\nOne of those who attended the meeting, Clare Perry, a prominent member of the new intake of Tory MPs, described \"this in-or-out discussion\" as \"a bit crude\", and said she thinks the choice is between \"the status quo or a renegotiation of the relationship\".\nThe wildest card of all is what happens in Europe itself.\nAlmost everyone now agrees that fundamental reform of the Eurozone is inevitable - whether the Euro survives as a currency or breaks apart.\nThat in turn is bound to have an impact on Britain's relationship with the Eurozone countries, and may well force changes in the way the wider EU works.\nFormer Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Lamont told Analysis that if the Eurozone countries form a tighter fiscal union, Britain might simply \"wave goodbye\" altogether.\nAnd Mark Seddon, a Labour Party activist who runs the People's Pledge campaign for a referendum on EU membership, believes the sort of changes that are likely to come will force the government to put the matter to the public.\nIt is exhilaratingly uncharted territory, and the choices to be made will probably not become clear until much closer to the next election in 2015.\nThose MPs who are so nervous about debating Europe now, may find that by the time they are ready to come out, the terms of the debate have changed beyond all recognition.\nAnalysis is on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 17 October at 20:30 BST and Sunday 23 October at 21:30 BST.

Now they promise to cut and cut and cut. Not because they have to, but because they want to.\n\"As George Osborne has said, the Conservatives will cut much deeper than is necessary to balance the books and make the poorest bear the heaviest burden.\n\"But at the same time they are promising tax giveaways for the wealthy, all of which must be paid for by yet more cuts to public spending.\n\"In the firing line are parents and police officers, soldiers and social workers.\"\nThis issue includes the wider economy and deficit reduction but also employment and the role of business.\nPolicy guide: Where the parties stand\nBut in an article in The Daily Telegraph Mr Cameron told the newspaper that Mr Clegg's attacks on him will fail, he said: \"I don't think it works because you can't run on your record and run away from your record at the same time.\"\nMr Clegg also went on to criticise Labour and said Ed Miliband's plans for the deficit would mean an extra \u00a3134 from every taxpayer being spent on debt interest payments.\n\"If the Conservatives will cut too much, Labour will borrow too much.\n\"Labour will borrow \u00a370bn more than we will - meaning an extra \u00a34bn just to pay the interest on our debt,\" he said.\nHis sentiments were echoed by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander who said the \"common thread\" running through the Lib Dem approach to tax was fairness.\nHe said: \"Fairness means that everyone should pay their taxes, zero tolerance of evasion and aggressive avoidance. Fairness means that as we finish the job of balancing the books, we should ask those who have the most to contribute to most.\"\nBut in response to Mr Clegg's claims Chris Leslie, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said nobody could trust the Lib Dems.\nHe said: \"They broke their promise not to raise VAT on families and pensioners and backed the Tory tax cut for millionaires.\n\"For all their claims, the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies says families have lost \u00a31,100 a year on average when all this government's changes are taken into account - including the changes to the personal allowance. Like the Tories, the Lib Dems give with one hand but take much more with the other hand.\n\"Labour's plan will back working people with fully funded tax cuts and reverse the Tory and Lib Dem tax giveaway for millionaires to balance the books in a fair way.\"\nMeanwhile, in an interview with The Economist, Nick Clegg has said that many of the voters who have stopped supporting his party \"want to be entirely bereft of any responsibility\".\nHe told the publication: \"There is clearly a section of the support we had in 2010 that was virulently anti-Conservative.\n\"They're the ones who still scream and shout blue murder and have done so without pause for breath for half a decade.\n\"And they're loud and they're noisy and they're angry. And that was a significant chunk of support that basically wanted to be associated with any party that didn't have the remotest sniff of power.\n\"There just is a constituency out there that wants to be entirely bereft of any responsibility.\"\nSubscribe to the BBC Election 2015 newsletter to get a round-up of the day's campaign news sent to your inbox every weekday afternoon.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Nick Clegg has attacked the Conservatives' plans for the economy as he stepped up his attack on his coalition partners since 2010.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Oschadbank - one of the country's biggest lenders - was among those that declined an interview with the BBC.\nEven now, almost a month after the so-called NotPetya strike, some companies inside and outside the nation are still facing disruption.\nUkraine's top cyber-cop disclosed that some of the nation's largest companies were still too scared to share the full scale of the fallout with his investigators.\nAnd Sergiy Demedyuk - head of Ukraine's ministry of internal affairs' cybercrime division - added he has come to believe there are aftershocks still to come since the hackers appear to have compromised their targets for some time before they pounced, and might still be sitting on data they could yet exploit.\nNotPetya initially appeared to be a ransomware attack, but many now suspect its blackmail demands were a cover for something more ominous.\nExperts who have spoken to the BBC are seemingly sure of two things: first, Ukraine was the target, and second, it was not about money.\nDespite denials, suspicion has fallen on Ukraine's eastern neighbour, Russia.\n\"Cyber-attacks are just one part of Russia's wider efforts to destabilise the country,\" Nato's former chief civil servant Anders Fogh Rasmussen told the BBC.\n\"In my time as secretary general we agreed that a cyber-attack could trigger Nato's mutual defence clause.\n\"The Alliance has been assisting Ukraine especially with monitoring and investigating security incidents. However... more support is also needed for prevention.\"\nOne cybersecurity veteran has been investigating how a local software developer's program, MeDoc, came to be hijacked to spread the malware.\n\"It wasn't just [a case of] take over MeDoc's update server and push out NotPetya,\" explained Nicholas Weaver from University of California, Berkeley.\n\"Instead, they had previously compromised MeDoc, made it into a remote-control Trojan, and then they were willing to burn this asset to launch this attack,\" he added, referring to the fact the servers have since been confiscated by the police.\n\"That really is huge.\"\nMeDoc's tax filing services were used by more than 400,000 customers across Ukraine, representing about 90% of its domestic firms.\nAlthough it was not mandatory for local companies to use it, by virtue of its ubiquity, it's almost as if it were.\n\"This was gold they had, basically a control point in almost every business that does business in Ukraine,\" said Mr Weaver.\n\"And they burned this resource in order to launch this destructive attack.\"\nMr Demedyuk said his police force had concrete evidence that MeDoc was hacked a long time ago and had been used to spy on economic activity within Ukraine.\n\"The [developers] claimed on their website that it was certificated, that it had been examined with international audit and it's 100% safe. In fact, it wasn't true,\" he added.\nOne ex-US Army cyber-expert said the hackers might have felt forced to carry out their attack through fear that MeDoc's computer servers were about to slip out of their control.\n\"If you read [security firm] ESET's report, you see that they gained and lost access repeatedly as legitimate MeDocs updates were pushed,\" Jon Nichols said.\n\"It is possible that the actors just wanted to cause as much damage as they could before they lost control again.\"\nThis theory is backed up by another US expert.\n\"It's not unheard of if you think you'll lose your position to launch prematurely,\" said Beau Woods deputy director of the Atlantic Council's Cyber Statecraft Initiative.\nHe added that if the perpetrators had, indeed, gathered financial data about most of Ukraine's companies, they might still find ways to cause further damage.\nMr Demedyuk said that although only four police officers had been assigned to his NotPetya investigation full-time, he had about 300 people across Ukraine supporting the inquiry.\nFurthermore, he has met with Interpol to discuss ways to share information with other international authorities.\nWhile they try to unravel how the attack was carried out, others are preparing for follow-up cyber-assaults.\nIn particular, the chief executive of Ukraine's state-owned energy giant Ukrenergo is concerned it will be a target.\n\"All our life as an independent country in the last 25 years, we've been connected to the Russian power grid and they've balanced us,\" Vsevolod Kovalchuk told the BBC.\nHowever, he explained, an agreement his firm has struck with European electricity transmission operators to modernise Ukraine's power grid might have put the firm in Moscow's cross-hairs.\nIt might sound like paranoia, but Ukrenergo had already been hit by two cyber-attacks prior to NotPetya.\nOne occurred just before Christmas.\n\"That virus worked in our local network for over one year,\" Mr Kovalchuk said.\n\"It collected information and after collecting the information, the hackers put another malware specific for our northern substation and switched it off for 15 minutes. It was only a test but they tried and it was successful.\"\nBefore that Ukrenergo was caught up in the infamous Black Energy attack, in December 2015. It took down half a city's power for three hours in the dead of winter.\nThe two incidents meant the firm was already battle-hardened when it was infected by NotPetya.\n\"A dispatcher called me and said they couldn't do anything because all of their screens had turned black and were asking for money,\" recalled Mr Kovalchuk.\n\"That was at 11:02 EET [Eastern European Time], and then several minutes later, other computers were in the same situation so I called to my chief IT officer and asked what is this, is this WannaCry or something similar?\" he said referring to a ransomware attack that disrupted the NHS and others in May.\n\"We disconnected our networks, switched off our computers, and then we used our protocols from the past, using paper standards, phones and continued to operate without any computers, without databases, without any systems.\"\nThis time round, the electricity grid was unharmed and power flowed uninterrupted. But the company was left without secondary functions for 10 days.\nFor Ukraine, the most important questions from here on seem to be: How bad does an attack have to be before serious international attention is paid to it? And: At what point does it become a war crime?\n\"I think that every six months, we'll see attacks,\" predicted Prof Michael Schmitt, lead author of the Tallinn Manual - the definitive international legal guide to cyber-conflict.\n\"Even though I'm not 100% sure that it's Russia, I don't understand which other country could attack Ukraine. It's the only logical answer.\"\nAnd Ukrainian cybersecurity experts like Alexey Yankovski believe every single business is at risk.\n\"Ukraine is a playground for attacks, and a large part of the cyber-security community here believes that most of the companies have already been infected,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Every company here should be prepared for the fact that it will be hacked sooner or later.\"\nThis week BBC News is taking a close look at all aspects of cyber-security.

But what if the overhaul of the UK's budget-making or fiscal constitution waters down that glue.\nHow much is at stake?\nWell, spending on public-sector services per head is highest in Northern Ireland, \u00a310,900 and it is lowest in England, at \u00a38,500.\nThe figure for Scotland - beneficiary of the famous or notorious Barnett Formula, which formalises an income transfer from England to Scotland - is \u00a310,200.\nSo expenditure on public services in Scotland is a fifth higher per person than south of the border, and it is 28% higher in Northern Ireland.\nIn Wales, the increment on public-service spending is 14% - which the Welsh have often complained is too little, compared with the transfer of income to Scotland.\nNow one way of looking at the scale of the transfer is to look at the amount of income - or what is known as gross value added - generated in each country.\nSo English gross value added per head is highest, at just under \u00a322,000, and it is lowest in Wales at \u00a315,400.\nThe English enjoy public-service spending per annum equivalent to under 40% of the income they generate, whereas annual outlays on public services in Wales are equivalent to more than 60% of nationally generated income per head.\nThe ratios for Scotland and Northern Ireland are just over 50% and not far off 70% respectively.\nIn a UK of considerable social and cultural solidarity that prevailed for most of the twentieth century, these sorts of disparities between income and outlay between the nations were relatively uncontroversial: they captured the idea that all UK citizens are in it together, as it were.\nBut today it seems almost inevitable that in David Cameron's brave new world of greater national fiscal self-determination, some English nationalist MPs on the right of the spectrum may increasingly view Wales - and Scotland and Northern Ireland - as de facto socialist paradises excessively featherbedded by the English.\nThat said, if the nations are given much greater control over income taxes - which appears to be what is on offer - could they not pay for whatever public services they feel they need out of these locally levied taxes?\nNot remotely.\nIncome and other direct taxes per head in Wales raise \u00a35,564, considerably less than the UK average of \u00a37,360, and nowhere near enough to cover public service expenditure.\nThere is a similar mismatch between direct income taxes and public spending throughout the UK.\nBorrowing and indirect taxes, mostly VAT, make up the difference. And there is not the faintest chance that national parliaments will be given the power to increase VAT, because this would be an admin nightmare for businesses and undermine the UK as a frictionless single market.\nAll of which means that it may sound exciting and empowering in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland to make their own choices about taxing and spending.\nBut it may also be a bit nerve-wracking (or worse) if it provides cover for Westminster to reduce the income transferred to them from English taxpayers.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "The big question about the Prime Minister's plan to hand more control over taxes, spending and welfare to the four nations is how far this would end the subsidy of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland by England, and especially by London and the South East.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

BrewDog won first, second, third, and fourth place.\n\"So we went down to Tesco's headquarters [just north of London], and they told us they loved our beer and wanted to put us in 500 shops, buying 2,000 cases a week,\" says Mr Watt.\n\"We put on our best poker faces and said 'no problem'. Yet we were just two guys filling bottles by hand.\"\nWith Tesco wanting first deliveries in four months' time, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie, also now 32, went to their bank to ask for another \u00a3150,000, so they could quickly install a bottling line, and expand production.\nBut failing to meet the payments on their existing loan, the bank said a firm \"no\".\nSo the business partners went to another lender, and lied.\nMr Watt says: \"We said that our bank had offered us an amazing deal, but that if you can match it we'll switch, and they went for it. You have got to do what you have to do.\"\nWith BrewDog now being able to increase its brewing facilities, it was able to start supplying Tesco on time with bottles of its Punk IPA.\nThe beer was an immediate hit, and the other UK supermarkets soon followed suit.\nFast forward to 2014, and BrewDog is due to see its turnover top \u00a332m this year.\nIt employs 357 people, and as well as continuing to supply the likes of Tesco UK-wide, it owns 25 bars, 18 across the UK, and seven abroad.\nAnd now based at a larger brewery down the road in the town of Ellon, it exports to 52 countries.\nChildhood friends who grew up in the Scottish town of Peterhead, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie started brewing beer together as a hobby in their early 20s.\nAt the time Mr Watt was working as a deep sea fisherman, while Mr Dickie was a whisky distiller.\nFrom the very start they were inspired to brew American-style craft beers - sweet-tasting ales with high alcohol levels and very large amounts of US hops, which gave them a bold, fruity, even perfumed flavour.\nThey are very Marmite beers in that you either love them or hate them. To fans they are flavoursome and interesting, to critics they are undrinkable.\nYet, confident they could convert drinkers, and after some good reviews, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie decided to quit their day jobs and start brewing professionally in 2007.\n\"Even though the first year was tough, we never lost faith in what we were doing,\" says Mr Watt. \"We were hell-bent... we were stupidly ambitious.\"\nIn addition to the bold flavours, the two men also worked hard on creating an irreverent brand image for BrewDog, giving their beers fun names, and bright, colourful labels. Some of their other brews are called Dead Pony Pale Ale, Dogma and Hardcore IPA.\nExpansion has been made possible after the business raised \u00a37m via crowdfunding, with 15,000 people paying \u00a395 for a stake in the company. In return they get discounts in BrewDog's bars, and other perks.\nIn more controversial matters, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie have also regularly - and enthusiastically - attacked regulators and industry bodies. Their critics say they do so simply to garner publicity, but Mr Watt says they are merely sticking up for themselves.\nEarlier this year the Portman Group, the UK drinks industry trade body that promotes responsible drinking, criticised BrewDog, saying that the label of the brewery's Dead Pony Pale Ale promoted anti-social behaviour and binge drinking.\nBrewDog's response at the time was as follows: \"Unfortunately, the Portman Group is a gloomy gaggle of killjoy jobsworths, funded by navel-gazing international drinks giants.\"\nWhen contacted by the BBC for this article, a spokesman for the Portman Group said: \"BrewDog's business model has traditionally used complaints by the public as a PR opportunity for their brands.\n\"BrewDog and the Portman Group have a long history... we don't expect them to like us, but we were pleased to see they have started relabeling their products.\"\nThere are no hard and fast rules on what makes a \"craft beer\". However, typically it is a natural beer made by a small brewery, often with large amounts of pungent hops and a marked sweetness from the barley malt\nSo what is the difference between \"craft beer\" and \"real ale\"?

Whether you like it or not, this is a sporting event that cannot be ignored.\nLas Vegas is a city that constantly beguiles visitors into altering their perceptions - and, at times, their common sense - in a haze of hedonistic pleasures. Mayweather v McGregor, with its unabashed glorification of money, image and bravado, fits perfectly within the daily excesses of the world's gambling capital.\nSaturday's fight will pit a man widely considered one of the greatest exponents of his sport against a mixed martial artist who has never boxed professionally.\nThe outcome should be simple to determine, no matter McGregor's mantra and hubristic claim he is ready to \"shock the world\".\nBut remember this is Vegas. And many believe McGregor's sleight of hand against an ageing Mayweather could provide a major upset. It will be no illusion if he does win, ranking as one of the greatest shocks in sporting history.\nThe debate as to who will triumph will sway back and forth in the coming days - pumped up, no doubt, by yet more hateful invective from the two chief protagonists.\nThe true verdict can only be delivered in the ring, in what is likely to be the richest fight in boxing history.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nTickets for the venue have not yet sold out - but with an expected five million pay-per-view purchases, the cash will cascade in from those sitting watching at home and at venues around the world.\nThe smell of money permeates the Las Vegas strip at the best of times. This week, the stench is inescapable.\nBoth fighters and their camps have been candid in admitting the contest is all about the cash. However, the language they have used to boost their mega pay day has been disgraceful.\nA five-city publicity tour in July became a nauseating race to the bottom as each man tried to find fresh insults to hurl at one another.\nHomophobic put-downs, and racially motivated slurs and stereotypes have soured the build-up to this contest. It was difficult not to wince when McGregor turned to his opponent on the final leg of the tour at Wembley and told him to \"dance for me, boy\".\nHowever, both men are equally culpable given their behaviour.\nDana White, the UFC president who is representing McGregor, believes it is all justified.\n\"It's funny when people say they've taken this thing too far,\" he said.\n\"This is a fight, not a croquet game. This part of the deal; the reality is what's going on here is just as much part of the fight as the fight itself, the mental warfare game.\"\nIt is at this point the true reality of this contest has not been altered but frankly obliterated.\nContext is everything and this fight is not taking place in a vacuum. The US is scarred and still reeling from recent events in Charlottesville, Virginia, where white supremacists marched with burning torches and gave Nazi salutes.\nIt is a country still deeply fractured along racial lines.\nIt is a country where prejudice - and the fight against it in all its forms - is a near constant part of the national conversation.\nIn their own small way, both Mayweather and McGregor, with every hateful word uttered, are expanding the pool of division that already exists in this country.\nSurely sport should be the place where differences can be set aside? This contest provides an opportunity for examples to be set but it has, so far, been wasted.\nTrash talk and one-upmanship is one thing. It has always been a part of prize fighting.\nLanguage that divides and excludes - that seemingly legitimises homophobic, sexist and racist behaviour - is something else entirely.\nThey certainly aren't the first boxers to trade in such terms.\nThough both men later apologised, Manny Pacquaio shamefully called people in same-sex marriages \"worse than animals\", while Tyson Fury expressed a Neanderthal view that a woman's best place is \"on her back or in the kitchen\".\nThe truth is boxing offers girls and boys a chance to build self-esteem, to train and dedicate themselves to a higher goal. It provides hope, and often an escape, for many.\nYou just have to listen to Mike Costello and Steve Bunce's recent podcast from the burnt-out Grenfell Tower to see what boxing can do for a community. The building housed a gym with volunteer coaches, all unpaid, giving their time and knowledge to help transform lives. The hope is it can rise again.\nBut some of the most powerful men at the top of the sport have failed time and again to see the gift they possess to inspire and encourage everyone, of all backgrounds, to get involved.\nMayweather and McGregor, cosseted in their elite world of Lamborghinis, Louis Vuitton luggage and flashy Las Vegas nightspots, appear to have forgotten this too.\nTheir humble beginnings at gyms in Michigan and Dublin respectively should serve as a reminder of the chances they were provided with.\nTheir respective combat sports have given them untold riches. This week their bank accounts will swell further.\nWith no boxing federation overseeing the bout and the Nevada State Athletic Commission - which sanctioned the fight - refusing to get involved, both Mayweather and McGregor can act however they wish.\nEven the UFC, in which McGregor made his name, has allowed the Irishman's actions to go unchecked of late. His volatile behaviour before recent events has seen him throw bottles and even try to hurl a chair at an opponent.\nThere is arguably a responsibility for the two most recognisable figures in combat sports to be more guarded with their words and to realise they are custodians; to extol the virtues of the sport that has given them everything.\nTheir most dangerous weapons, it seems, are not their fists but their tongues.\nNo-one expects them to be angels - the true, unaltered reality this week is they have a fight to sell and money to make. And on Saturday a truly intriguing sporting contest will take place.\nHowever, the orgy of excess that surrounds it threatens to further sully a sport that right now needs all the help it can get to maintain popularity and relevance.\nWhat happens in Vegas should, according to the old saying, stay in Vegas. Hopefully that also applies to the hateful rhetoric of this unavoidable fight.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "At the top of the MGM Grand on the Las Vegas strip is a huge advert for the magician David Copperfield, the hotel's star attraction.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

That is the problem with thrilling wins like the one in Cardiff: they inflate expectations, convince the giddy that a team is not just ascendant but untroubled.\nEngland started slowly, again, and were once again behind with a quarter of the contest gone. They then took control for half an hour, played with pace and imagination and considerable verve, and were out of sight by the time Italy staged their late and immaterial fight-back.\nThat will be enough for some. In the corresponding fixture two years ago Stuart Lancaster's men were held try-less. In Jonathan Joseph they had not only Saturday's outstanding performer but a young dancer and dasher who is terrifying defenders and delighting supporters every time he is given the ball.\nLancaster, for one, wants more. Miss 22 tackles in Dublin on Sunday week and he knows dreams of a Grand Slam will remain exactly that. Give away breakdown penalties to a side with a player who can kick off the tee - Ireland's Johnny Sexton will not be as profligate as Italy 10 Kelly Haimona - and it will be a far steeper road back.\nFor George Ford, man of the match in the Millennium, this was a different sort of challenge in a different sort of match.\nSo far in his nascent Test career the 21-year-old fly-half has had to deal with a disorganised Samoa, an Australian pack going backwards at pace and a giant Welsh back-line determined to dent both his confidence and body.\nA week ago there was plenty of kicking from hand, a resolve under intense pressure, a premium on his penalty points.\nOn Saturday he could have missed every effort from the Twickenham turf and still seen his side win with something to spare. Instead it was all about the attack - controlling the tempo, choosing his options, freeing the talent outside him.\nHe began well, clearing from his own line off his weaker foot after Ben Youngs' poor pass had cut his time and space. A minute later he was putting a probing kick deep into Italian territory, dabbing another into the 22 only to see it gathered to begin the move that led, 70 metres and two minutes later, to Sergio Parisse's opening try for Italy.\nFord, as the win over Wales showed, is not cowed by early disappointment. It was his precision long-range penalty tight to the corner flag that set up England's opening try through Billy Vunipola's line-out drive, his ability to play flat to the gain-line that was creating options for the runners and ball-carriers cantering in support.\nNot always did he make the right choice. Half an hour in he wasted turnover ball with a poor kick straight down the gullet of his opposite number Haimona. At other times he became a fraction static, passing the ball standing still rather than running at the defensive line to commit and confuse defenders.\nBut in his vision and hands he has what England fans crave from their number 10: creativity, a little conjuring, the quickness of mind and foot to make it count against a well-drilled defence.\nSo it was in the move that led to Joseph's second try. He hung behind his pack, hinting that he might drift down the blind-side, then scything back round to the open spaces on the right after Billy Twelvetrees had come in at first receiver.\nTwelvetrees timed his pass behind Luther Burrell, and then Ford worked his magic - spotting Anthony Watson drawing one defender wide, faking a quick pass outside to Joseph and then delaying it a fraction as the covering man committed, before popping up a pass for his Bath team-mate to come onto at full pace.\nAfter the conversion he was gone, replaced for the final hurrah by another creative mind in Danny Cipriani. But the learning-curve continues, his precocious talents an increasingly pivotal part of Lancaster's plans.\nHis personal stats were solid rather than spectacular: 15 points, just one kick missed from tee from seven, 47 metres made with ball in hand, 31 accurate passes. His kicking style requires a little further fine-tuning, even if he has improved markedly in the last year.\nThere is so much there, and at such a young age, that few doubt that the progression will continue.\nThere is the character, preternatural yet visible from the moment he began playing in England's age-group teams ahead of his time. There are the little details, like the way he manages to almost imperceptibly shift his weight in contact to ride out or roll big tackles. And there is ambition: this is not enough, I must do more.\nThere is also a connection with the key men outside him. Joseph made more metres (123) than any other player, beat five men in seven carries, made two clean breaks. It was Ford's pass that set him away both times.\nTogether with the solidity of England's set-piece, the impact of their replacements and the form in other key positions of Chris Robshaw and Ben Youngs, it means England are aware of two things: they must aspire to better still, but they have the tools to get there.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "After the unexpected delight for England supporters of last week's stirring comeback victory over Wales, Saturday's 47-17 win over Italy appears a predictable pleasure: six tries, some scintillating running, a 21st victory in 21 contests between the two.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

One is potential revenue from carmakers in the long term.\nAnd what is also crucial to the development of self-driving vehicles is data. The more cars using its technology, the more data it should be able to harvest.\n\"It really sounds like they want to treat this like a smartphone platform,\" Mr Chao said. \"The holy grail for software in cars is to become the Android or iOS that everyone is using, and this is their strategy to do that.\"\nBaidu's statement alludes to opportunities in the US, but also in its home market.\n\"China is the world's largest market for automotive sales and production. It has many car brands and an open environment that is ripe for collaboration,\" group president Qi Lu said.\nAnalyst Mr Chao agrees. \"I can think of at least 20 Chinese carmakers who would be perfect candidates,\" he told the BBC.\n\"They don't have huge research budgets or the resources to figure out how to make self-driving vehicles themselves.\n\"These are firms that tend to rely on suppliers so they can build a car and so this fits in perfectly for them.\"\nHe said this could mean that Baidu's technology will be used in millions of cars on China's roads by 2020.\nHowever, bigger international carmakers who are already working on autonomous vehicles are unlikely to follow suit.\nMotivated by the widespread pollution problems, Beijing has pushed for more electric vehicles and Chinese carmakers have responded significantly.\nAnd in the race for driverless car technology, Chinese companies are taking big strides. Along with Changan and Geely, Baidu is one of the big players, with AI research being done in both China and Silicon Valley.\nBut it is not clear how the software and hardware Baidu has developed compares with that of its rivals. Some analysts say it has done less testing, and therefore has less data to work with, than Google and Tesla.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Chinese internet giant Baidu has said it will share much of the technology it has created for its self-driving cars.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The attention to detail is stunningly intricate and it was Manchester City's own training complex which offered key elements of the blueprint.\nA group of journalists are led through the $14m development by Forrest Griffin, a retired UFC light-heavyweight champion and now a vice-president with focus on athlete development.\nHe paints details around what we see at the 30,000 square feet facility, which opened in May. Some 23 years have passed since UFC was formed but this building is seen as a game changer which will take the welfare and performance of athletes to new levels.\nIt is far removed from the spit and sawdust gyms which shaped some of boxing's greatest names. Some 24 hours earlier, I visited the Mayweather Boxing Gym, a world-renowned facility which inside is straightforward, humble and brilliantly effective.\nBut the UFC institute cuts with tradition in pursuit of gains. Measurability, science and mapped progress shape the mantra.\nGriffin explains how recovery is meticulously plotted. He points to one of his own injuries and a subsequent substantial difference in mass between his two quad muscles, detected after his retirement. A UFC fighter at the Institute would be scanned during rehabilitation to highlight which muscles have suffered during their lay-off so targeted rebuilding can be done.\nAny fighter competing under the UFC banner can train here at no cost.\nTailored workout programmes appear on screens next to weight stations. If an athlete is only here for a short spell, their data and subsequent training plan will be sent to an app to use at their traditional base.\nWhatever the goal - recovery, strength, mobility, technique - there is a desire to offer a menu of ways to work on it. As Griffin stresses, what works for one individual will do nothing for another.\nIn the recovery area, for example, athletes can opt for use of a cryotherapy chamber or laser-light therapy. Both will stimulate circulation, flushing away lactic acid and easing aches and pains.\nFacilities are purposely placed one room apart to ease access. We pass through a door and Griffin fires up the underwater treadmill McGregor has been filmed using in recent weeks.\n\"Conor has had a knee injury in the past so he doesn't like to do roadwork,\" says Griffin, 38.  \"So he does a lot of bike work and he uses this as it has no impact on your body and you can work hard.\"\nTwo pools next to the underwater treadmill offer temperatures of 105F and 50F respectively to again offer variety in recovery.\nGriffin explains why McGregor's typical routine of sleeping in until midday makes perfect sense.\n\"He's been here once or twice a day for six weeks,\" adds Griffin. \"Training at the time you fight is under appreciated. When do you work out the best, after being up for 12 hours or three or four hours? He primes his body to do that, which is intelligent.\"\nWe are taken to meet UFC flyweight Joe Benevidez, who is receiving treatment from director of physical therapy Heather Linden.\nLinden left a role at the USA's Olympic Training Centre in Colorado Springs to be here. She jokes when explaining how even the toughest UFC fighters can struggle on a pilates ball when she isolates their weakest muscles in order to highlight where work is needed.\n\"What's been a shock is how little access to services these athletes have had in the past,\" she says. \"It's amazing how some of them have never had medical guidance for preventative measures.\n\"I've had to build trust. I had a guy come in here and tell me he couldn't feel his left arm but he was going to fight. He was scared of telling people in the event he was pulled from competing but with work we restored him to full functionality in two weeks.\"\nFormer UFC welterweight Dan Hardy is part of the tour. The Nottingham-born 35-year-old describes the facilities as \"night and day\" to what he used.\n\"My life would be different now,\" he tells the group. \"I used to work with friends for treatment, driving around for different things I needed.\"\nDespite all the technology in what feels like the slickest of finishing schools, MMA critics still exist. Perhaps blighted by images of the ground and pound or blood-stained faces they question the morality of the sport.\nBut UFC's growth shows no sign of relenting. The company was sold for $4.2bn in 2016 and listening to Griffin it is obvious this is a sport with vision.\nMapping the layout of the Institute saw the UFC research facilities at the likes of Man City, the Phoenix Suns basketball team and the USA Olympic team base.\nHabits were observed, such as an athlete's occasional tendency to neglect post-workout nutrition if access to it was not made easy. Consequently, UFC athletes can only exit the building by passing a nutritional team.\n\"We learned from mistakes people had made in the past,\" adds Griffin. \"A facility and its staff may be too spread out. Manchester City have a great layout. The locker room is the centre of the building. The athletes start and end in the locker room so you build every service around that.\n\"Every sport taxes the human body a certain way. The needs and demands change but the impact on the body and the recovery needed is very similar.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nElsewhere on the ground floor we see anti-gravity treadmills which take away impact, a 50m outdoor track and walls with numbered targets for medicine balls to be thrown at.\nThe altitude chamber McGregor sometimes cycled is in use. This transparent box lets people look in at the world of pain it can serve up. Griffin proudly states UFC stars can now create conditions to prime them to fight anywhere on earth.\nIn a gym packed with contraptions, he points to pressure plates in the floor. Squatting and lifting weights while planted on these will deliver data on which limbs are offering the greater power. Once more, it offers a way to drill down and improve weaknesses.\nGet the biggest boxing news sent straight to your device. Find out more.\nWe are led up stairs boasting the slogan \"legends become champions and champions become contenders\". These take us away from a ground floor focused on welfare and strength and to an upper tier which measures 17,000 square ft and is MMA specific.\nBags of varying shape and size hang there, an octagon dominates the room and of course, there is McGregor's boxing ring, home of those now infamous spars with Paulie Malignaggi.\nHe is of course a fighter obsessed with detail. This desert treasure chest caters for that intricacy in abundance.\nAnd if all of the facilities have somehow polished him to a point where he can shock Mayweather at the T-Mobile Arena, UFC's main draw will achieve a status which will shine new focus on the company.\nIts Performance Institute tells us the organisation is nothing but ready to thrive and what is more, it now boasts a factory primed to build the next McGregor.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "If Conor McGregor beats Floyd Mayweather on Saturday night in Las Vegas, the boyhood Manchester United fan will perhaps owe a small debt of gratitude to Manchester City.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

You never know when you drop players into a new group whether it'll be the right thing to do.\"\nEngland, who had Premier League quality in Tottenham striker Harry Kane, Everton defender John Stones and new Liverpool forward Danny Ings, lost 1-0 to Portugal, beat Sweden by the same score but then lost 3-1 to Italy.\nAshworth had a key role in the FA introducing proposals - the 'England DNA programme' - in December aimed at improving England's prospects at major tournaments.\nThe plan is to co-ordinate the style, formation and tactics from the under-15 side upwards.

That's what the Germans had to do before becoming very successful.\n\"Do they get too much too soon? It's very difficult for the coaching staff.

Well, you can find a summary of his policies on his campaign website, but here's a quick tour.\nPerhaps his most radical idea is to impose hefty tariffs on Chinese-made goods, if China does not reform its trade relations with the US.\nMr Trump has floated the idea of a swingeing 45% tariff on Chinese imports.\nIn a big economic policy speech in June he told workers at a metal processing plant that China had \"cheated on its currency, added another trillion dollars to our trade deficit and stole hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property\".\nDuring that speech he reminded workers that President Reagan had imposed tariffs of 45% on Japanese motorcycles and 100% on computer chips.\nIf Mr Trump's threat crystallised it would supply a shock to the US economy as China is an important supplier of many goods.\nTake mobile devices for example. China supplies three-quarters of the phones imported into the US and it supplies almost all laptop and tablet computers.\nMr Trump has also been scathing about the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).\nIntroduced in 1994 it greatly reduced, and in some cases eliminated altogether, tariffs for trade between the US and its two immediate neighbours, Mexico and Canada.\n\"Nafta was the worst trade deal in the history of this country,\" Mr Trump said in June.\nHe blames the deal for the loss of thousands of US manufacturing jobs and wants to reverse that by renegotiating the terms of the deal.\nIf Mexico and Canada do not agree to the new terms, Mr Trump has threatened to withdraw from the agreement altogether.\nIn February, after five years of work, the US and 11 other nations signed up to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), one of the biggest multinational trade deals ever.\nThat agreement now looks dead as Mr Trump has called it a \"horrible deal\" and said that he would block it.\nThe deal involves 12 nations from around the Pacific Rim, and was partly designed to counter the growing economic power of China.\nHowever, Mr Trump claims that trade with those nations had already cost the US two million jobs - with the manufacturing of cars and car parts particularly suffering.\nA lot of work has also gone into a new trade deal between the US and the European Union.\nSince 2013 the two sides have been negotiating the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP, aimed at removing or reducing trade barriers.\nThat deal has faced opposition in Europe and now, with a US administration that is sceptical over trade deals, looks even less likely to reach fruition.\nAn existing deal under threat is the 2011 free trade agreement with South Korea.\nAccording to figures quoted on Mr Trump's campaign website, the deal has cost 100,000 jobs and has not resulted in any increase in US exports to South Korea.\nWhile many nations might have their trade deals torn up, the UK might well be looked on favourably by the Trump administration.\nThe president-elect was a supporter of the UK leaving the European Union and last month his trade adviser Dan DiMicco told the BBC that negotiating a new trade deal with the UK would be \"one of the first things\" that his trade officials would do.\nMr DiMicco also said that Mr Trump was serious about his threats over trade: \"Things have gotten so bad that we will leave Nafta, WTO [the World Trade Organization] and the Korean Free Trade Agreement if we can't get a fair deal.\n\"These are not idle threats.\"\nBut the WTO has congratulated Mr Trump on his victory and appeared to acknowledge his concerns over jobs.\nThe WTO is \"ready to support the administration to ensure trade is a positive element in a new strategy for development & job creation,\" tweeted director-general Roberto Azevedo.\n\"It's clear many feel trade isn't working for them. We must address this and ensure trade delivers the widest benefit to the most people,\" he added.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "At his victory rally in New York US president-elect Donald Trump promised \"great, great relationships\" with other nations.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Weighing a tiny amount, I bought children's clothing and consumed fewer than 500 calories a day.\nAnorexia nervosa is far from just a battle of wills to resist eating a chocolate bar. It's a serious mental illness. A possession. As though developing a split personality\u200a-yourself and the anorexia. In fact, that's exactly what happened to me.\nPrior to the illness, I'd been a happy girl and enjoyed a great relationship with my parents, but that deteriorated when anorexia embedded itself in my head. I developed techniques and deceptive ways to make it look like I'd eaten when I hadn't.\nI'd dispose of food in literally any way I could. I became sneaky and desperate, and I'd lie constantly, dreading any time away from school because home-time meant food time.\n'I've eaten' techniques included sprinkling toaster crumbs on a plate to make it look like I'd had toast. I'd hide any food down sleeves, in pockets, in bras, in my cheeks, anything to avoid swallowing it. I'd mop up milk from my cereal with tissues.\nFor a girl who loathed maths more than she currently hated life, I became highly adept at calorie calculation.\nFor a girl who loathed maths more than she currently hated life, I became highly adept at calorie calculation. And I knew how much EVERYTHING provided me with.\nMy mum was immediately on my tail when I started to get thin. I'd exercise compulsively\u200a\u2014\u200aliterally anything to burn calories. I'd relish any chance to get away from my parents so that I could burn calories exercising. I remember running laps of the playground during Girl Guide hours in the evening because it was the only time I could run and burn calories. My patrol must have thought I was very strange.\nNow that I was below a healthy weight, my periods had stopped and I was attending weekly appointments at the Youth Hospital seeing a dietician and a psychologist. I was clinically depressed and spent every day being force-fed by my parents while I screamed and cried like a banshee at the threat of being fed two spoonfuls of ice cream.\nI could see my thighs were bigger in the mirror after eating anything calorific. That delusion to me was as real as the glass itself.\nThe body dysmorphia was terrible. I could see my thighs were bigger in the mirror after eating anything calorific. That delusion to me was as real as the glass itself. I believe that I still suffer from this dysmorphia a little even now, over ten years later and at a much healthier weight.\nMy recovery was largely down to my mum, whose persistence in monitoring my every move eventually forced the voice in my head to say 'I can't win this', and slowly begin to shrink back. I remember that moment vividly as though the anorexia actually admitted defeat and resigned.\nTo this day, I can see a girl in the gym and know that she's struggling. I think it's in the arms. There's one at my gym right now. I see her working her tiny limbs like a demon on the spin bike, only she barely has any real muscle to power herself.\nThe fight to create a more versatile fashion and beauty industry is still one which is continuing relentlessly today. ALL healthy bodies are beautiful in any shape, any size and any form.\nIt's not about banishing sample sizes from the runways, TV and magazines, it's about creating body diversity. Young girls need to see models walk down the catwalk with healthy bodies resembling that of the average woman. They shouldn't have to be labelled as 'plus size', because they're not. They're just women.\nNote: BodyPositive has removed some of the more sensitive aspects of this story.

Can you hear me?\"\nOn its blog, Esa said Philae had contacted Earth, via Rosetta, for 85 seconds on Saturday in the first contact since going into hibernation in November.\n\"Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35C and has 24 watts available,\" said Philae project manager, Dr Stephan Ulamec.\nScientists say they now waiting for the next contact.\nEsa's senior scientific advisor, Prof Mark McCaughrean, told the BBC: \"It's been a long seven months, and to be quite honest we weren't sure it would happen - there are a lot of very happy people around Europe at the moment.\"\nPhilae was carrying large amounts of data that scientists hoped to download once it made contact again, he said.\n\"I think we're optimistic now that it's awake that we'll have several months of scientific data to pore over,\" he added.\nThis is one of the most astonishing moments in space exploration and the grins on the faces of the scientists and engineers are totally justified, says BBC science editor David Shukman.\nFor the first time, we will have a hitchhiker riding on a comet and describing what happens to a comet as it heats up on its journey through space, he adds.\nPhilae is designed to analyse the ice and rocky fragments that make up the comet.\nProf Monica Grady from the Open University told the BBC that scientists now hoped to be able to carry out experiments to see whether comets were the source of life on Earth.\nComets contained a lot of water and carbon, and \"these are the same sorts of molecules responsible for getting life going,\" she said.\n\"What we're trying to find out is whether the building blocks of life, in terms of water and carbon-bearing molecules, were actually delivered to Earth from comets.\"\nWhen Philae first sent back images of its landing location, researchers could see it was in a dark ditch. The Sun was obscured by a high wall, limiting the amount of light that could reach the robot's solar panels.\nScientists knew they only had a limited amount of time - about 60 hours - to gather data before the robot's battery ran flat.\nBut the calculations also indicated that Philae's mission might not be over for good when the juice did eventually run dry. The comet is currently moving in towards the Sun, and the intensity of light falling on Philae, engineers suggested, could be sufficient in time to re-boot the machine.\nAnd so it has proved. Scientists must now hope they can get enough power into Philae to carry out a full range of experiments.\nOne ambition not fulfilled before the robot went to sleep was to try to drill into the comet, to examine its chemical make-up. One attempt was made last year, and it failed. A second attempt will now become a priority.\nReturn of the plucky robot\nPhilae's extraordinary opportunity\nRosetta: The whole story\nThe Rosetta probe took 10 years to reach 67P, and the lander - about the size of a washing-machine - bounced at least a kilometre when it touched down.\nBefore it lost power, Philae sent back images of its surroundings that showed it was in a dark location with high walls blocking sunlight from reaching its solar panels.\nIts exact location on the duck-shaped comet has since been a mystery.\nEsa had a good idea of where it was likely to be, down to a few tens of metres, but could not get Rosetta close enough to the comet to acquire conclusive pictures.\nContinued radio contact should now allow precise coordinates to be determined, correspondents say.\nComet 67P is currently 205 million km (127 million miles) from the Sun, and getting closer.\nIt is due in August to get as close as 186 million km, before then sweeping back out into the outer Solar System.\nAs it nears the sun, the comet will warm and its ices will melt.\nThis process will throw out a huge shroud of gas and dust, and if Philae can continue to keep working it will provide scientists with an extraordinary view of what is happening right at the surface of 67P.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "The European Space Agency (Esa) says its comet lander, Philae, has woken up and contacted Earth.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Without his imagination it would have been lost forever; so it's fitting that his son has gone on to be waterways manager on the Kennet and Avon Canal.\"\nIn its heyday the Swansea canal was a feat of 18th Century engineering; with 36 locks and five aqueducts carrying the water from 365ft (111m) at Abercraf, to where it reached sea-level at North Dock.\nFor a century and a half it carried around 400,000 tonnes of coal, iron and steel each year to feed the Industrial Revolution.\nIndeed, several towns and villages such as Ystradgynlais, Ystalyfera and Clydach owe their very existence to its success.\nBut by the turn of the 20th Century it was feeling the pinch from the competition of railways, and the last commercial barge to travel the canal was in 1931.\n\"So much of our history came down that canal, from the copper works of Swansea, to the iron of the valleys, The Mond Nickel Works, and what was at the time the biggest tinplate works in the world at Pontardawe,\" said Mr Davies.\n\"After its closure in 1931 it was briefly used during World War Two, but after that it was gradually covered over.\n\"Back then there was no interest in preservation. There's even a piece of 1960s BBC news footage, talking about what a fetid eyesore it was, and how it needed to be built-over as soon as possible.\"\nWhilst the reopening of lock number seven is still some years off, demolishing some of the transport depot and reinstating the towpath to extend Sustrans National Cycle Route 43 could be achieved relatively quickly.\nAttention will then turn to dredging the navigable section of silt, with a view to holding a trail boat festival there in 2019.\nMr Davies now believes that the time has come where public thinking has turned full-circle away from burying our past.\n\"With the success of projects like the extension of the Liverpool-Leeds canal, authorities are recognising that for every \u00a31 they spend on restoration, they can make back \u00a37 in tourism,\" he said.\n\"If we can get the Swansea canal to reach the Fendrod River, onto the Tawe, and back to the docks, from there it would only take a short section of new canal to meet up with the Neath and Tennant Canals.\n\"That would give us a U-shaped 35-mile (56km) stretch which would take around three days to cruise, and how much tourist revenue could that raise?\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Constructed between 1794 and 1798, the Swansea canal once ran for more than 16 miles between Swansea and Abercraf, and was the artery which created the Swansea valley as we know it.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Repeat offenders could face up to five years in prison.\nBut critics have said it may lead to UK citizens being refused accommodation.\nThe proposals - to be included in the upcoming Immigration Bill - come as the British and French governments struggle to deal with a migrant crisis in Calais, where large numbers of people are making nightly bids to cross the Channel to reach the UK.\nUnder the proposals for landlords in England, the Home Office would issue a notice when an asylum application fails that confirms the tenant no longer has the right to rent property.\nAnalysis by legal correspondent Clive Coleman\nIt is currently a criminal offence to remove tenants without a court order. Obtaining that order enables bailiffs to evict tenants. That all takes time. The new measure may cut out court orders, but it is unclear:\nThis will trigger a power for landlords to end the tenancy, without a court order in some circumstances.\nLandlords will also be required to carry out \"right to rent\" checks on each tenant's immigration status before allowing them to move in, expanding a pilot that has been running for a year in the west Midlands.\nRepeatedly failing to do either would be a new offence carrying maximum penalties of five years' imprisonment or a fine.\nA blacklist of \"rogue\" landlords and letting agents will allow councils to keep track of those who have been convicted of housing offences and ban them from renting out properties if they are repeat offenders.\nCommunities Secretary Greg Clark acknowledged that cases in which tenants refused to move out would still end up in court but that the process would be quicker because landlords would have official \"evidence\" to present to the courts of their tenant's status.\n\"You have saved the landlord having to spend money establishing something that is clear and that the Home Office can provide - which is a clear statement of whether they should be there or not,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nAsked whether evicting migrants simply increased the risk of people disappearing altogether, unless immediately detained by the police, Mr Clark said the initiative was part of a \"joined-up system to send people home\".\nAnalysis, by Alicia McCarthy\nThe streets of the UK are not paved with gold. That's the clear message the government wants to send to those tempted to come to Britain illegally.\nMinisters say the tightening of the demands on private landlords in England is simply the enactment of a manifesto promise to make them carry out the same checks as employers and that migrants need to know there is no right to work or rent a home if you are in the UK illegally.\nIt's not clear yet how the scheme will work or what impact it will have other than moving illegal immigrants from where they are living.\nAnd some may suspect the timing of the announcement is a response to the nightly television news pictures showing scores of desperate migrants trying to cross the channel - and to criticism from some that ministers have failed to get a grip on the situation swiftly enough.\nFor Labour, shadow immigration minister David Hanson said he backed tougher checks but said ministers appeared to be \"offloading\" the problem on to landlords and it was up to the authorities to decide whether people should be allowed to remain or deported.\nSince August 2014, private landlords in five councils - Dudley, Sandwell, Wolverhampton, Walsall and Birmingham - have been required to conduct checks to establish new tenants have the right to rent in the UK or face face a penalty of up to \u00a33,000.\nMr Clark said the pilot - introduced as part of the 2014 Immigration Act - had been a success and would be extended across more of the UK, although he could not say how many people had been deported as a direct result.\nBut the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said the pilot - which has yet to be officially evaluated - had serious shortcomings.\n\"We have heard that British people with foreign accents are finding it difficult to get tenancies from some of the, you might say, unscrupulous landlords,\" its chief executive Habib Rahman told Radio 4's World at One.\nAnd David Smith, from the Residential Landlords Association, said there was evidence of \"document discrimination\" with some landlords reluctant to rent their properties to anyone who could not produce a valid passport.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Landlords in England will be expected to evict tenants who lose the right to live in the UK  under new measures to clamp down on illegal immigration.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

After the chaos of the Cultural Revolution and the tragedy of the Beijing massacre in 1989, young people are not allowed to demonstrate in China.\nBut some now hound their enemies online. The underlying rage is reminiscent. The instinct for intimidation is the same. Despite all its strengths and all its engagement with the world, China is once again prey to political groupthink and fear.\nThe latest trigger is a speech by a Chinese student at an American campus. On 21 May, at an official event, Shuping Yang praised the fresh air and freedom of speech she had found at the University of Maryland.\nThe video clip of her speech quickly went viral and triggered an outpouring of anger from fellow Chinese students in the US and critics at home. Shuping Yang swiftly apologised, asked forgiveness and said she had no intention to belittle her country. But that was not enough to stop the flood of \"I am proud of China\" posts accusing her of lies and deception, or the online \"human flesh searches\" to dig up incriminating information about her and her family.\nOf course there are good reasons to be proud of China and every Chinese citizen is entitled to list them. In the past week alone, China has sent a submersible deep into the Mariana Trench and its world champion go player Ke Jie took on the AlphaGo AI computer programme and almost beat it. Every day ordinary Chinese people display the energy, talent and hard work of which their fellow citizens should be proud.\nBut being proud of China does not mean denying another Chinese citizen the right to an opinion. In fact, Shuping Yang herself said she too was proud in her message of apology.\nThe irony is that the very backlash against her has only served to make her point about the want of freedom of speech in her homeland. It has also highlighted a conflict between a commitment to free speech in Western countries that host large communities of Chinese students and the growing determination of the Chinese government and some of its citizens that free speech should be limited when it comes to talking about China, even beyond Chinese borders.\nFreedom of speech is any society's feedback loop. It means precisely the freedom to say what is different or what may even offend. Of course, different societies have a different view on how much of this is appropriate. But if China's freedom of speech goes no further than parroting the leader and attacking those who dare to speak from a different script, then its spirit is lurking in the shadow of the Mao era.\nWhich brings us to Chairman Xi and his style of leadership. In English Xi Jinping is usually referred to as President Xi. But his power comes from being leader of the Communist Party and since taking up that role five years ago, he has collapsed the distinction between party and government and dramatically shrunk the space for freedom of speech.\nAll public debate, whether in the media, academia, the legal profession or online, is a shadow of what it was in 2012. It is now off-limits to discuss universal values or liberal democracy.  Instead China must loudly unite around the leadership of the Communist Party and \"tell China's story confidently\".\nConfidence is understandable. In Xi Jinping's first five-year term, China has become the world's second-largest economy and an increasingly powerful military power. But when Chairman Xi urges journalists, think-tanks and diplomats to \"tell China's story confidently\" he does not mean tell it how you like and with your own nuance. Students abroad are a particularly important voice in this chorus. It is stated Chinese government policy to \"assemble the broad numbers of students abroad as a positive patriotic energy\".\nAnd so when the University of California San Diego announced that it would host a speech by Tibet's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama next month, the local Chinese Students and Scholars Association consulted with diplomats and threatened \"tough measures to resolutely resist the school's unreasonable behaviour\". At Durham University in the UK, the Chinese Students and Scholars Association, again with the support of the Chinese embassy, attempted to bar from a debate a critic of China's religious policies and human rights record.\nThis week's mobilisation against Shuping Yang, complete with commentaries in leading state media, is part of this drive for \"positive patriotic energy\".\nAll of which causes some bafflement on the campuses concerned. Students from countries with a tradition of free speech may feel irritation with someone who criticises their homeland in a public speech, but their instinct is usually to shrug it off or make a joke. Likewise when Chinese state media deploy students from Western countries praising China and its policies, such individuals do not become hate figures for outraged student associations or national newspapers.\nThat's because liberal societies take differences of opinion for granted. In the US, in Europe and in Australia, citizens regularly excoriate their own governments and praise other countries in the media, and on satirical TV and radio shows. They also mount protests against their leaders.\nIt is vital to Beijing that these habits should not rub off. So in Chairman Xi's era the numbers of Chinese students studying abroad is going up but their tolerance of diverging views on China is going down.\nIn one respect, this is puzzling. At great expense, young Chinese have chosen to move from the confines of China's tightly-controlled education system to the \"fresh air\" of campuses which cherish tolerance and which offer all the tools to explore a range of different narratives of their own place in the world through reading and debate. But it is not so puzzling if you factor in these students' prior ideological education, the pressure on them to perform academically, and the ever-present and watchful eye of the Chinese state.\nTension is likely to grow between the liberal values of Western campuses and the \"positive patriotic energy\" of the growing numbers of Chinese students on these campuses. But the very strength of the reaction to Shuping Yang's freedom speech ensures that her words will continue to echo.\nAfter all, it's not just Western culture which honours a loyal opposition. It is firmly entrenched in the historical memory of China too. Respect resonates down through the centuries for officials and soldiers in the imperial and the more recent Communist era who braved banishment or death for daring to speak truth to power.\nSo be #proudofChina by all means, but don't go back to the frenzy of the Red Guard era, and remember that in all great civilisations, the patriots whose memories endure are often those who love their country enough to point out its flaws.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Half a century ago millions of Chairman Mao's Red Guards gathered in rallies in Tiananmen Square to chant slogans and wave their red books of his quotations in a show of loyalty to the ideas of the \"Great Helmsman\".", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Three were tied up and covered with hessian bags because Mr Entsch miscalculated the number of transportation cages.\nHe told the BBC he was given a loaded handgun and warned not to shoot the fuel tank if the crocodiles escaped their makeshift restraints.\nThe animals became ill due to altitude sickness, leading them to vomit and defecate throughout the plane. \"They went ballistic,\" Mr Entsch recalled.\nCrocodile farmer John Lever, from Koorana in Queensland, has been on multiple trips to gather eggs from crocodile nests.\nThe 63-year-old said he had some close calls with crocodiles, but \"it's a bit like having a near miss in your car, you go off and forget about it\".\n\"You learn to manage behaviour about the nest, but when a big male challenges you at night and you're on a little boat on the river in the dark that can be pretty intimidating when they're 5m (16ft) and three quarters of a tonne (750kg),\" Mr Lever said.\nThe estuarine crocodile is protected as a vulnerable species under current Queensland legislation, a point of conjecture on both sides of the debate.\nThe state government says it will only back the egg harvesting plan if it does not threaten the animal's survival in the wild.\nMr Millyard said accurate surveys of crocodile populations had not been conducted for a decade and needed to be completed before a decision was made.\n\"Anything people say about crocodile numbers is really hearsay and opinion,\" he said.\nThe final report into a trial live egg collection trial in Cape York - the largest and most intact tropical savanna left on Earth - is expected to be released by the Queensland Government in the coming weeks.\nRobbie Morris, environmental manager of Pormpuraaw Aboriginal Shire Council in Cape York, said the study has shown there would be no impact on populations if a limited harvest of wild eggs are taken from nests that would already be washed away by flooding.\n\"Wild eggs could be taken and hatchlings reared without influencing the population,\" he told the Cairns Post.\n\"If we do actually get the go ahead to do a wild egg harvest there would be scope for three or four permanent positions at the farm for local indigenous people.\"\nThe Australian Conservation Foundation's Andrew Picone said a range of issues needed to be considered before allowing egg harvesting in Cape York.\n\"At face value it presents some problems [but] if there's not any economic opportunities on the Cape [York] things like mining and other extractive industries will continue to be seen as the only option, and undermine tourism,\" Mr Picone told the BBC.\nHe agreed that expanding the farming industry in Queensland could also provide culturally appropriate opportunities for remote indigenous communities.\nMeanwhile, the Northern Territory recently increased the number of eggs that can be harvested each year by 40% to 90,000 viable eggs.\nIts Wildlife Trade Management Plan also allows for the take of 1,000 live crocodiles.\nThe government aims to double its crocodile products industry to A$50m ($35m; \u00c2\u00a324m) in four years.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "It is the stuff of Boys' Own adventure novels - rugged Australians dropping into wild saltwater crocodile nests to snatch day-old eggs from territorial females.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

It would be very difficult to meet multiple diverse local needs effectively, or to maintain fair democratic representation within such areas.\"\nMr Andrews has dropped plans to place \"term-limits\" on councillors, whereby an individual would only be able to serve for 25 years.\nHe is also proposing the current cap of 75 members per council be raised to a higher level.\nIn a written statement, Mr Andrews added: \"I want to emphasise this is not a final decision. It is the next phase in discussions.\"\nA draft bill will be published in the autumn but no changes will be made before next spring's assembly election.\nMr Andrews is confident his plans are on the right side of the political argument, despite criticism from senior Labour council figures.\nHe told BBC Wales: \"Welsh Labour will be happy to go into the election next year campaigning to reduce the cost of politics and administration in local government.\"\nBut the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) dismissed the proposals, saying there was \"no political consensus\" on the future shape of councils, either across political parties in the assembly or between Welsh ministers and local authorities.\nThe WLGA called for an  \"urgent summit\" of council leaders and the Welsh government.\nAssociation leader Bob Wellington, also the Labour leader of Torfaen council, said: \"This summit could debate the way forward in terms of structures, but more importantly set in place a new vision for local government which is currently at the epicentre of public sector funding cuts and is having to carry a disproportionate share of the huge austerity burden.\"\nThere was fierce criticism of Blaenau Gwent's proposed merger with Caerphilly, Newport, Monmouthshire and Torfaen from its local Labour AM, a former environment minister.\nAlun Davies said such changes would \"only distract from the important issue of focusing on the challenges facing us as a borough\".\nUrging Welsh ministers to \"listen and to reach out with meaningful discussions\", he added: \"Simply issuing diktats is the worst way to promote debate and discussion.\"\nDominic MacAskill, from public services union Unison, said it would be \"demanding that staff, our members, are put at the heart of considerations and that Welsh government commits to providing adequate funding for the transition costs of any restructuring\".\nMr Andrew's proposals came under immediate fire from assembly opposition parties.\nConservative shadow local government minister Janet Finch-Saunders condemned what she called an \"uninspiring map\" chosen to \"best serve the tribal party political interests of the Labour Party instead of ensuring proper local representation for families across Wales or delivering efficient local services\".\nPlaid Cymru's Rhodri Glyn Thomas welcomed the fact the Welsh government had \"made clear its preferred map\", but criticised the plans for not integrating health and social care.\nLiberal Democrat AM Peter Black said \"shoving together existing councils in a botched party-political stitch-up serves no-one aside from the Labour party\".\n* There could be further consultation on merging Conwy and Denbighshire to create an additional council in north Wales.\nCOUNCIL LEADERS' REACTION\nBlaenau Gwent: Labour leader Hedley McCarthy said it appeared \"we are to be the periphery of a new mega-council which will be distant and remote from the people it is supposed to serve\".\nDenbighshire: Independent council leader Hugh Evans said the authority was \"unclear about what, if any, review has led to the current proposed map\".\nBut he said a possible consultation on combining Denbighshire with Conwy, rather than with Flintshire and Wrexham, deserved \"serious consideration\".\nGwynedd: Dyfed Edwards, a Plaid Cymru councillor, told BBC Radio Wales: \"I do think in the north, dividing along north east and north west is right. I think two authorities is enough for the north.\"\nMonmouthshire: Conservative Peter Fox accepted the need for some reform but expressed disappointment.\nHe said: \"We're back to the future it looks like. I believe in local identity and local decision making, I believe that's really important to people.\"\nPembrokeshire: Independent council leader Jamie Adams said he was worried about the \"obvious loss of local decision-making and accountability\" and the \"real damage reorganisation could do to a very successful brand\".\n\"I am referring to the Pembrokeshire name, which is instantly recognisable to those living far outside our county and even beyond Wales,\" he said.\nRhondda Cynon Taf: Labour council leader Andrew Morgan said: \"All council leaders will now need to consider the detail of the Welsh government's proposed map; I personally will want to remain focused on protecting the interests of services we provide to the communities we represent currently and the staff we employ to deliver them.\"\nSwansea: Labour council leader Rob Stewart said he did not think the planned merger with Neath Port Talbot held \"any fear\" for the two authorities.\nHe said: \"We already work as a city region. Swansea is undoubtedly the capital of that region but it doesn't mean people in other parts of the region should worry.\"\nVale of Glamorgan: Labour council leader Neil Moore said a plan for a voluntary merger involving his authority and Bridgend was turned down in January because it would cross a local health board boundary.\nHe called it \"bizarre\" and \"galling\" for Mr Andrews to now want Bridgend to join Merthyr and Rhondda Cynon Taf across another local health board boundary.\nANALYSIS BY VAUGHAN RODERICK\nThe third shake up in Welsh local government in 40 years would see the return of some familiar borders and names, the new all-purpose authorities roughly matching the eight counties which formed the upper tier of Welsh councils until 1996.\nWhile some will welcome the return of historical names like Gwent and Dyfed - others would mourn the passing of the equally historic names like Pembrokeshire and Monmouthshire.\nWhile sentiment may fire opposition to the changes in some areas, other will claim that the new authorities could prove remote and that any change would be a distraction at a time when local government is under severe financial pressure.\nMeanwhile the issue is likely to figure heavily in next year's assembly election, with all three opposition parties opposing the government's map.\nTHE CHANGING FACE OF WALES\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Reducing the number of councils in Wales from 22 to eight or nine would cut the cost of local government, the public services minister has said.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Crucially, it could be digested in acid, reverting to its original components.\nThis digestion reaction allows the chemical building blocks, or monomers, to be reused.\n\"It was definitely fortuitous,\" Dr Garcia said. \"The first thing I did, of course, was to hit the literature, to try and see if it'd been done before. I just assumed that it had been - it's such a simple reaction.\"\nBut her search turned up nothing. This was new.\nOnce she understood what she had created, Dr Garcia set about repeating her finding. \"We wasted a lot of flasks,\" she said.\nBecause they are strong and light-weight, thermosets are used throughout modern cars and aircraft, often mixed with carbon fibres to form composites. Some 50% of the new Airbus A350 jet, for example, will be made from composites.\nYet until now, none of this thermoset plastic could be recycled.\n\"The potential impact here is phenomenal,\" said Dr Charl Faul, a materials chemist at the University of Bristol. He says the study offers a \"very simple, elegant answer to a very old problem\".\nDr James Hedrick, who was in charge of the research at IBM, is excited by the possiblities. When a large or expensive component is damaged or reaches the end of its useful life, he explained, it could be repaired or recycled instead of thrown away.\n\"The ability to rework saves a tremendous amount of money and mitigates waste.\"\nBeyond replacing thermoset-based composites in current technology, Dr Hedrick sees the potential for many more innovative applications. \"We're at the discovery phase,\" he said. \"Every time you discover a new polymer-forming reaction it leads to all sorts of new materials.\"\nAs well as very hard and durable plastics, the researchers adapted their procedure to a different monomer and produced flexible, self-healing gels. These could be useful in anything from cosmetics, to paint, to the design of drug capsules, because of their particular solubility properties.\n\"Applications are running like water,\" Dr Hedrick said. \"We don't even know where to go with this yet.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Researchers have developed a collection of new plastics that are recyclable and adaptable - and the discovery began with a laboratory mistake.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

There we've really made a big difference in the UK. We've created the world's most generous tax breaks for that kind of investment.\"\nThe second type is \"scale-up cash\" to help companies grow, which is still proving \"a big challenge\".\n\"There is a big role for government in providing a bunch of that funding, particularly when it comes to research in the laboratory and helping that go to market,\" he says.\nMr Woodford agrees that financing is a major constraint.\n\"We have four of the top 10 universities in the world, 29 of the top 200. We do science and research really, really well in the UK and we're generating lots of little companies,\" Mr Woodford said.\nAccording to him, it is after this stage that the problems emerge.\nMr Woodford argues that UK investors are too short-term and do not have the scale to support small technology firms.\nHussein Kanji, co-founder of Hoxton Ventures, agrees: \"It would still be hard for something like an Uber to be born out of the UK because I don't think there's a financing community that would give Uber the billions of dollars that it has consumed to get to global stage.\"\nOthers point out that Silicon Valley has had longer to perfect the process.\nEileen Burbidge has worked at Apple and Yahoo and is now a venture capitalist based in London.\n\"They [Silicon Valley] did have an ecosystem that was cultivated in the 1940s and 1950s frankly by the US government and the defence industry that were originally in that part of California.\"\nOne problem, Mr Silva says, is the UK's entrepreneur relief which gives a lower capital gains tax when businessmen and women sell their company.\n\"The problem is this relief perversely encourages you to sell out early. If you did decide to try and build a Google or an Uber in this country, you'd actually pay a much higher tax rate than if you'd sold out and decided to live in a country mansion after a few years.\"\nMr Woodford also believes that UK entrepreneurs have been too quick to sell out once the business gets going.\nBut this is not a path that Taavet Hinrikus, chief executive and co-founder of London based peer-to-peer money transfer service TransferWise, is intending to follow.\nHis company has become what is known as a unicorn - a company set up since 2000 which is now valued at more than $1bn (\u00a3770 mn). There are fewer than 20 in the UK.\nHe said he would not sell-up at the moment.\n\"We're just getting started with the company so why should we stop now? What would I do? I'd go on the beach for a day and then I would become incredibly bored and I would have the same urge to change the world for the better. I think starting over would be going backwards,\" Mr Hinrikus said.\nAnother theory is that universities aren't being supportive enough.\n\"We haven't been as opportunistic, adventurous and entrepreneurial as others,\" said Annalisa Jenkins, boss of Dimension Therapeutics, a gene therapy innovator.\n\"In the past academics have traditionally viewed success, quite rightly, as their ability to publish their research in leading journals... the notion of turning their inventions into innovations that really drive value for people hasn't really been rewarded and recognised in terms of the culture of our country in the last 20 to 30 years,\" Ms Jenkins said.\nYou can listen to the packages containing these interviews on the Today Programme on Monday.

Predictions are uncertain - many things could change in the years to come.\nIn the tricky world of modelling the future, there is some consensus on at least one thing.

The sustained low price was further pulling back on investment plans.\nThe economists argued that this month's Westminster budget should avoid a further squeeze on spending, as tax revenues appeared to fall short of previous expectations.\nProf Brian Ashcroft, author of the regular Fraser of Allander reports, said that would slow growth further and worsen the flow of tax revenues to the exchequer.\nThe report said that job creation should continue but forecasted a slower rate of growth. The central forecast for net employment increase was 36,800, whereas in November, it was 45,000.\nThe report also warned of the effect of the UK being taken out of the European Union, following the referendum in June.\nIt claimed the uncertainty about the outcome of the vote would have a negative effect on investment.\nIts analysis of the European choice was that \"it is difficult to imagine that it would help improve Scotland's competitive position to our trade with the EU\".\nIt noted that the fall in electronics and other manufacturing exports had meant Scotland already found it hard to penetrate open EU markets.\nThe Strathclyde report said Scottish exporters would find it more difficult if the trade arrangements were changed. Also, productivity could be slowed, when it was already relatively weak.\nThe latest report from Fraser of Allander noted that the Scottish economy still benefited from low inflation and low interest rates and earning power had been increasing slowly.\nHowever, it reflected on the strength of Sterling, making imports cheaper and exports more difficult. That factor had weakened in recent weeks, though trade had been slowing globally.\nIt said growth had been depending too much on rising and unsustainable household debt.\nPaul Brewer, a senior partner at PwC which sponsors the Fraser of Allander reports, said: \"The potential for the forthcoming budget to exert further fiscal tightening, oil price uncertainty and the uncertainty surrounding the potential outcome of the EU referendum, together create a difficult environment for business and investor confidence.\"\nHe suggested the UK Chancellor could help the economy with a further cut in tax on oil producers.\nAt sector level, the analysis said the service sector was the driver of growth, although financial services showed little sign of recovery to pre-recession levels.\nThe production sector had contracted in the most recent official data, and construction had ceased to be the driver that it was of Scottish growth.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "Growth in the Scottish economy is failing to pick up pace, according to one of Scotland's main forecasters.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

Has the much vaunted Burmese reform project ground to a halt?\nThe answer depends on how narrowly you define reform. When she speaks, Ms Suu Kyi is thinking politics.\nThe pace of political change has certainly slowed.  In part that's because the easiest reforms took place in the first 18 months of Thein Sein's presidency.\nIn the Burmese context, \"easy\" means decisions that don't upset the army.\nPolitical prisoners were released, censorship of newspapers and the internet lifted and a (flawed) law passed allowing public demonstrations.\nIn a short period of time, one of the world's most tightly controlled societies opened up in a way few had thought possible.\nStories critical of ministers were suddenly on the front page of private newspapers, and demonstrations, mostly connected to land rights, have become almost daily events.\nBut the early pace of those changes hasn't been sustained. There was no way it could.\nSo did the reformers run out of steam? Did Thein Sein's project reach a roadblock manned by hardliners in the Burmese army? Or perhaps we're close to the final destination - that is, with sanctions lifted and the army still really in charge.\nMs Suu Kyi's main frustration is that the constitution remains unchanged.\nDrafted in 2008, it entrenches the military's control of political life, guaranteeing it a quarter of the seats in the Hluttaw (the Burmese parliament), and a veto over any changes to the constitution.\nThis is what its architects proudly call a \"disciplined democracy\".\nThe opposition have focused on the two parts they want changed most.\nThey are: the clause barring anyone who has foreign family members from becoming president, which effectively prevents Ms Suu Kyi from taking power (because of her British sons) and Article 436, which gives the army a veto on constitutional changes.\nMuch of Ms Suu Kyi's annoyance stems from the fact that the legislature that she joined in 2012, and thus legitimised, is now being cynically used to thwart her ambition.\nJust as it would in mature democracies, responsibility for shaping the constitutional reform process was handed to a series of parliamentary committees.\nWith each committee mirroring the composition of the military-dominated Hluttaw, they've deliberated for months and delivered entirely predictable results.\nAltering the \"Suu Kyi clause\" has been dismissed outright (as a threat to national sovereignty), while amending Article 436 will be discussed in parliament, though if the army remains opposed there's no way it can be changed.\nMs Suu Kyi's slim hopes of taking the top job after the election in 2015 now rest on a backroom deal among senior leaders.\nLooming in many minds is the possibility of a constitutional crisis this time next year. What if the party that wins the most seats is unable or unwilling to nominate a president?\nThough the changes that Aung San Suu Kyi wants most have stalled, that's not to say there haven't been other important developments.  It's just that they don't directly involve Ms Suu Kyi.\nEver since independence in 1948, Myanmar has never been truly at peace, with minority ethnic groups fighting guerrilla wars against the Burman-dominated state.\nThe last three years has seen real progress towards what would be an unprecedented nationwide ceasefire agreement. All the major rebel groups have been brought into the process, attracted by the promise of dialogue on a more federal future.\nFor President Thein Sein, a peace agreement would be the crowning achievement of what's likely to be his only term in office. Unfortunately for him, with a deal within reach, the number of clashes has begun to increase once more.\nOutside politics, particularly in the big cities, people's lives are changing fast.\nThanks to new laws and regulations, Myanmar's economy and banking sectors are liberalising and opening up to the outside world. GDP growth is rapid, though improvements in living standards still lag a long way behind.\nOn Myanmar's streets two new foreign phone companies are currently battling it out for a lucrative new market.\nAfter years in which mobile phones and the internet were government-run and SIM cards the preserve of the elite, there's now the prospect of low-cost data and unrestricted access to information. In itself that's a game-changer.\nSo is the Myanmar reform glass half full or half empty?  It rather depends who you are, and what you're drinking.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "At a press conference last week, opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was asked for her assessment of Myanmar's reform process.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

I think there is an awful lot of work for us still to do.\n\"There is a danger that we put an over-negative spin on where we've come in the last decade because actually we've made fantastic progress.

It should be remembered, however, that that target was significantly loosened last year.\nSo, with a better economic outlook, will the Budget be a time for a few politically targeted giveaways?\nThere will be some limited action. The Treasury was certainly stung by accusations following the Autumn Statement that Philip Hammond did not mention the NHS or social care funding despite predictions of a looming crisis.\nExpect more money for social care, more money for business rate relief and more money for schools.\nIndividual tax thresholds - the point at which people start paying tax on their income - will also be increased, getting ever closer to the target of \u00a312,500 of tax-free income promised in the Conservatives' 2015 manifesto.\nBut each move will be limited.\nYes, the Treasury will have a modicum of borrowing headroom,  but officials have created a long list of headwinds that could knock the economy off course.\nEeyore still wonders if an earthquake might strike.\nFirst, the tax base is eroding as more people join the \"gig\" economy - the self-employed who work for companies such as Uber and Deliveroo and pay less tax. Gig employers also pay less in national insurance and pension contributions.\nMr Hammond wants a review of the tax status of the self-employed, ready for major announcements in the autumn, when the new cycle of November Budgets begins.\nTreasury officials are also convinced that some of thegood news on increased tax receipts are \"one-offs\" - changes to self-assessment rules and corporation tax payments that will not be repeated.\nThen there are the fears about the Brexit process, when officials worry that \"good days and bad days\" news coverage will affect economic confidence.\nInflation is also on the march, government borrowing costs on its \u00a31.7 trillion debt load are rising and the UK's age-old productivity problem refuses to go away.\nMr Hammond and Theresa May are both fiscal conservatives - cleaving strongly to the idea that \"balancing the books\" between what a government receives in taxes and spends on public services is the only way to maintain economic stability and growth.\nThe Prime Minister apparently often interjects in policy committee meetings with the question: \"Where is the money coming from?\"\nGiven that background, better economic news and better borrowing figures are not about to lead to big Budget giveaways.\nEeyore just wouldn't countenance it.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "\"We haven't had an earthquake lately,\" was Eeyore's tart response when asked about forecasts that the weather can only improve in the Hundred Acre Wood.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
